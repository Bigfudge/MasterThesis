2018-01-28: Started building indata for SVM. Prob. need align-script to decide
if word is wrong or not. Meeting with Dana, got feedback for planning report.
Should fix planning report next time.

2018-01-29: Hopefully fixed all feedback on planning report, can probably send
back to Dana tomorrow. Tomorrow should I finish the planning report and find and
use align-script (evaluation-script).
