ON THE SYSTEMATIC POSITION OF 
ÆLUROPUS MELANOLEUCUS 

BY 

K. S. BARDENFLETH 

﻿


﻿In the year 1869 A. Milne Edwards received a letterNouvelles Archives du Muséum t. V, 1869, Bull. pag. 13. from the traveller Père 
A. David, dealing with several new mammals collected by him in the Eastern 
Thibet, and among these was a kind of bear found in the province Moupin which 
he named Ursus melanoleucus and of the exterior of which he gave a short
description. He added: 

“Je n'ai point observé dans les cabinets d'Europe cette espèce qui est bien la 
plus jolie du genre que je connaisse; puisse-t-elle constituer une nouveauté pour la 
science!” 

This wish was sufficiently fulfilled; the zoologists have played at battle-door 
and shuttle-cock with the animal, from the Ursidæ to the Procyonidæ and back 
again. 

In March of the following year Milne Edwards shortly wrote about itA. Milne Edwards: Sur quelgues Mammifères du Thibet oriental (Annales des Sciences 
naturelles, Tome XIII, série 5, 1870.): 
“. . . Par sa forme extérieure, il ressemble en effet beaucoup à un Ours, mais les 
caractères ostéologiques et le système dentaire l'en distinguent nettement et le
rapprochont des Pandas et des Ratons. Il doit constituer un genre nouveau que j'ai 
appelé Ailuropoda.” 

But this name being preoccupied in another sense, P. GervaisP. Gervais: Mémoire sur les formes cérébrales des Carnivores (Nouvelles Archives du 
Muséum, Tome VI, 1870.) after
examining a plaster cast of its cranial cavity named it Pandarctos, considering it as an 
aberrant Ursid with some Panda-like features. 

At the same time A. Milne Edwards altered the name to Ailuropus which is 
used by A. David in his “Rapport”A. David: Rapport présenté a l'assemblée de MM. les professeurs-administrateurs du Mus. 
d'Hist. nat. (Nouv. Arch. du Mus., Tome VII, Bulletin, 1871. Pp. 88 and 92.) 1871 (15, December) where he writes: “M. 
A. Milne Edwards a créé pour lui le genre Ailuropus.” He also resumes the 
words of Milne Edwards about its systematic relation cited above. 

The first detailed description of its exterior, its skull and its teeth was given   



﻿by A. Milne Edwards in 1874A. Milne Edwards: Recherches pour servir à l'histoire naturelle des Mammifères. Paris
1868—74, pp. 321-38.. From this description he concludes as follows: 
“L'ensemble de faits que je viens de passer en revue prouve que l'Ailurope ne peut 
être rapporté à aucun des types génériques précédemment connus. Il appartient 
indubitablement à la famille des Carnassiers arctoides, dont les Ours sont les
principaux réprésentants, et il ressemble beaucoup à ces animaux; mais il tient encore 
plus peut-être des Pandas, et il présente un singulier mélange des caractères
ostéologiques. Ainsi, par le mode d'articulation de la mâchoire inférieure, l'énorme
developpement des arcades zygomatiques, il ressemble aux Félins les plus robustes, et 
quelques naturalistes le comparent à l'Hyène; mais la conformation de ses dents 
mâchelières indique que c'est en réalité un animal moins carnivore que ne le sont 
les Ours. Par leur forme générale, ses grosses molaires tuberculeuses ressemblent 
beaucoup à celle de l'Urside fossile désigné sous le nom d'Arctotherium bonariense, 
par M. P. Gervais. — Par la disposition de la couronne, le penultième molaire a 
beaucoup d'analogie avec les molaires de divers Pachydermes fossiles, notamment du 
Choeropotamus parisiensis, et l'on aurait trouvé cette dent isolée, qu'on l'aurait 
rapportée à un herbivore pachyderme. Néanmoins c'est entre les Ours et les
Pandas que l'Ailurope doit prendre place dans nos classifications méthodiques, et la 
division qui la renferme, me paraît avoir une valeur zoologique plus considérable 
que celle de la plupart des genres dont se compose l'ordre des Carnassiers” (pag. 
335—6). — This decision of the position of the animal among the Arctoidea is far 
less definite than the former of the same author; it is interpreted as an
intermediate form between the two families Ursidæ and Procyonidæ. 

A description — unfortunately rather cursory — of the skeleton was given by P. 
Gervais in 1875P. Gervais: De l'Ursus melanoleucus. (Journal de zoologie, tome IV, 1895.). About the relationship of the animal he writes: “Cette étude 
m'a conduit à le rapporter aussi à la famille des Ursides, dans laquelle il occupe 
toutefois une place à part, ce que l'on pourrait rappeler en en faisant une tribu 
distincte parmi ces animaux”. (Pag. 78). In short, it is to him an aberrant member 
of Ursidæ, but not of Procyonidæ. 

In his article “Mammalia” in the British EncyclopædiaBrit. Encyclopæd. Ed. 9., vol. XV, 1883. W. H. Flower
regarded it as a true representative of the Ursidæ, but connecting them with Ælurus 
(which to him formed a distinct family) and with several extinct genera. 

The same place is occupied by Æluropus in W. H. Flower and R. Lydekker: 
“Mammals”W. H. Flower & R. Lydekker: An introduction to the study of Mammals, living and
extinct. London 1891., where it is said: “in the large size and complex crowns of the upper
﻿premolars this genus differs very markedly from the true Bears. The fourth upper 
premolar (carnassial) makes no approach to the markedly sectorial type presented 
by the corresponding tooth of Hyænarctus, its structure being, on the whole, more 
like that of Ælurus.“ (pag. 561). 

H. WingeH. Winge; Jordfundne og nulevende Rovdyr (Carnivora) fra Lagoa Santa etc. E Museo 
Lundii 2 bd. 2. halvbd. København 1895—96. places still more exclusively Æluropus among Ursidæ as a very near 
relative of the Hyænarctus, these two forming together a branch of the Ursine stem, 
whereas Ælurus belongs to the Procyonine stem of Procyonidæ whose root is
Bassaris. A true relationship between the two species is thus out of the question. 

But Æluropus was not allowed to stay among the Bears; in 1901 E. Ray
Lankester and R. LydekkerE. Ray Lankestor & K. Lydekker: On the affinities of Æluropus melanoleucus. (Transact. 
Linn. Soc. London, ser. 2, vol. VIII). asserted, after a careful comparison between its skeleton, 
especially the limb-bones, and that of Ælurus and Ursus, that it must be closely 
associated with Ælurus, and should be named the “Greater Panda”, not the
“Particoloured Bear”: “In spite of the difference in their dental formula, it appears
reasonable that if Ælurus be included in the Procyonidæ, Æluropus should likewise find a 
place in the same family. The two may indeed be regarded as the representatives 
of a subfamily of the Procyonidæ — the Ælurinæ.“ (p. 171). 

In 1904 Max WeberMax Weber: Die Säugetiere. Jena 1904. following Winge's views placed Æluropus near Hyænarctus 
among the Ursidæ, and 1913 the present writerK. S. Bardenfleth: Notes on the form of the Carnassial Tooth of Carnivorous Mammals 
(Vidensk. Møddelelser fra den Naturh. Foren. i København bd. 65). shortly treated the form of the 
upper carnassial of carnivorous mammals and among those also that of Æluropus. 
By examination of the position of the roots he tried to prove Winge's assertion that 
the inner cusps of the carnassial of Æluropus were homologous with those of Ursus, 
not with those of Ælurus, the anterior one being not the sixth cusp (Winge's
indication, = protocone Osborn), but a strongly developed cingulum-cusp. He added: 
“The other resemblances between Æluropus and Ælurus seem to me to be mostly 
analogous features due to the adaptation to the same habits” (p. 106). Of this 
the present short paper will try to give fuller proofs. 

In the following list I have paralleled some of the characters of Ælurus,
Æluropus and Ursus.

﻿This synopsis of the characters of Æluropus shows us an animal with several 
Ælarus-like, and several original characters. But if we not only count them, but 
also weigh them, we can certainly reach a more decisive result. 

The coloration gives us no hold. It is unique in Æluropus, but it is almost so 
also in Ælurus, though the brown colour of the latter reminds us of the colour of 
Nasua, the annulated tail and the stripes on the snout of some of the other
Procyonidæ. — Mammals with the belly darker than the back are rather rare; among 
the Carnivora they are found among Canidæ (Canis vulpes var. melanogaster and 
perhaps other varieties, Nyctereutes procyonoides, Icticyon venaticus), among Mustelidæ 
(Gulo borealis, the Foetorius-group, Vison, Mellivora, Mephitis, Thiosmus, Meles,
Ictidonyx, Poecilogale, Galictis barbara), among Procyonidæ only Ælurus. — The
capricious coloration of Æluropus may perhaps be interpreted as a case of partial 
albinism, in adaptation to the cold snow-covered mountains where it lives, like the 
total albinism of Ursus maritimus, Canis lupus var. alhus and other mammals in 
the ever-white polar regions. 

The skull is very peculiar; P. Gervais compares it with that of Hyæna. The 
most characteristic feature, and the starting-point for understanding it, is the
immensely developed dentition. And the origin of this is to be sought in the food of the 
animal. But unfortunately its biology is very little known. Milne Edwards says (1874, 
pag. 336) that it feeds principally on roots, young bamboos and other vegetables, and 
A. David writes as follows about the same subject (l871 pag. 89): “Il . . . paraît 
avoir un régime végétal; mais pourtant l'on dit qu'il ne refuse point le chair quand 
s'en présente; et même je pense que c'est sa nourriture principale en hiver, saison 
dans laquelle il n'est pas sujet à rester endormi”. — That Æluropus does eat meat, 
seems very likely, judging from the sharp-edged anterior premolars, but it must 
have been hard and tough vegetables which have developed the peculiar molars, 
which almost resemble the teeth of some Suidæ. 

As in animals with very strong teeth the muzzle is very short, in order that 
the teeth may act with the greatest possible force, but the teeth being all in
activity (except p 1/1) they cannot become shortened and must consequently be very 
crowded. But nevertheless m3 can hardly be called rudimentary, not even so much 
as in Ursus; that means no doubt that this tooth is still of importance to the animal 
and, therefore, not indifferent in systematic respect. Ælurus has lost it, but as a 
kind of compensation m2 has a large backward elongation. 

To move the immense lower jaw with force very strong muscles are required; 
they give the brain-case with its strong crests the peculiar and characteristic 
Hyæna-like form. And they press the zygomatic arches outwards in order to get 
the necessary space. The articulation of the lower jaw needs sufficient fixedness;
﻿consequently the condyle and the glenoid cavity become very enlarged, and the 
temporal root of the zygoma is more heavy than in any other Carnivore. 

The exceedingly strong processus postglenoideus abuts against the flat,  
Ursus-like bulla; and as the heavy head — which is made still more heavy by the great 
specific gravity of the bones, which is, I think, only exceeded by the specific
gravity of the bones of the Sirenia — requires very powerful neck-muscles for
supporting and fixing it, the occiput becomes very broad. This in connection with the 
large postglenoid process gives a peculiar antero-posteriorly compressed appearance 
to the basis cranii. That explains the form of the bulla, the short distance between 
the glenoid cavity and the mastoid process, the extraordinary place of the meatus 
acusticus externus and the nearness of the foramina to each other. — The 
systematic importance of the alisphenoid canal seems somewhat doubtful. It is absent in 
Felidæ, present in Viverridæ (except in Viverricula, Cynogale [according to Flower, 
absent according to Mivart], Galidictinæ, Eupleres, Proteles), absent in Hyænidæ, 
present in Ursidæ, absent in Æluropus, absent in Procyonidæ (except Ælurus),
absent in Mustelidæ. — Steno’s fissure is absent in Procyonidæ, present in Ælurus, 
absent in Ursidæ, present in Æluropus. 

The resemblance between the skull of Æluropus and that of Ælurus is due to 
a convergent development of the teeth. According to Flower & Lydekker (l. c. 
pag. 562) it feeds chiefly on fruits and other vegetable substances; David says (1871, 
pag. 89): “Du reste, le petit panda, Ailurus fulgens, .... tâche aussi de varier, 
avec de la viande, ses repas, qui d’ordinaire consistent en végétaux, fruits, feuilles, 
bourgeons, pousses de bambous sauvages, selon la saison”. Evidently the food of 
the two animals is nearly similar and must have the same effect on the teeth, and 
these again on the form of the head: the short muzzle, the large and crowded 
multicuspid teeth, the wide zygomatic arches, the expanded glenoid cavity and large 
processus postglenoideus, — all is due to the same cause. The obliquely cut ends 
of the mandibular condyles are not unique among the Carnivores; they seem to be 
characteristic of animals with strong articulation and large processus postglenoidei, 
they are e. g. very conspicuous in Meles, also to be seen in Hyæna and others. The 
strong muscles which require a large area for attachment, dilate the processus
coronoidei and give them their peculiar form. But as the brain-case is relativly 
larger in Ælurus than in Æluropus, the muscles get sufficient space on it without 
transforming it as in Æluropus, and the smaller and lighter head requires not so 
strong neck-muscles, therefore the basis cranii is not so much transformed as in 
Æluropus, and the typical Procyon-like bulla is not altered. 

The Bears are omnivorous animals; young European bears feed chiefly on soft 
fruits, young sprouts and other soft vegetables, even the polar bear is said to eat 
﻿grass in the summer (Flower & Lydekker pag. 558). Therefore the crowns of their 
molars are more flat; they do not require so much force for crushing and cutting 
their food; the molars are reduced, p 2–32–3 often disappeared, the muzzle often rather 
long, the muscles not very strong. And consequently the zygomatic arches are not 
wide, the sagittal crest low, the mandibular articulation not so expanded, processus 
postglenoideus rather low, the neck-muscles do not cause an antero-posterior 
compression of the hind part of the brain-case, etc. 

Thus we are entitled to say that the resemblances between the skull of 
Æluropus and Ælurus can all be derived from the convergent development of their teeth 
which are adapted to crush tough vegetables; but the resemblance between 
Æluropas and Ursus — the form of the bulla, the presence of m3, the construction of p4, 
the form of the space between the pterygoids etc. — is due to real generic 
connection. 

As to the limbs, at the first glance they seem to be more Panda-like than 
Bearlike; but if the head of Æluropus is a modified bear-head, the resemblance between 
the limbs of Æluropus and Ælurus must also be of adaptive nature. But 
unfortunately we are not sufficiently acquainted with its life-habits to give a full 
explanation of the features of the limbs, nor are the muscles known. But as a general 
rule we may say that the limb-bones of Æluropus differ from those of Ursus and 
resemble those of Ælurus in being shorter, stouter, more expanded at the ends than 
in Ursus, and the ridges and other parts of the bones where the muscles are  
inserted, are formed more like those of Ælurus. That seems to me to indicate that the 
two animals move in the same manner; no doubt Ælurus climbs trees, the larger 
Æluropus perhaps climbs on the rocks. 

The presence of an entepicondylar foramen is of no great significance, being 
generally absent in Ursus, but often present in U. ornatus and according to Gervais 
(1875, pag. 86) also in Arctotherium bonariense and Hyænarctos. Its appearance in 
the other carnivorous families is also somewhat irregular like the appearance of the 
foramen alisphenoideum. According to W. K. GregoryWill. K. Gregory: The orders of Mammals. (Bulletin of the Amer. Mus. of Nat. Hist. vol. 
XXVII, 1910, pag. 436). its presence may be a primitive feature. — The form and size of the radial sesamoid on the carpus is quite 
unique among Carnivora, it suggests to us the “os falciforme” of Talpa (though 
the latter is articulated with the distal end of radius); in Castor we find a 
sesamoid with the same position and nearly the same size as that of ÆluropusFlower: Osteology of the Mammalia, London 1885, fig. 96.. 
Also in the foetal carpus of Didelphys (W. K. Gregory l. c. pag. 440 fig. 9) and in 
some climbing rodents we find a similar bone. Thus its presence may indicate 
﻿either burrowing or climbing habitsH. Winge: Jordfundne og nulevende Gnavere fra Lagoa Santa etc. (E Museo Lundii, Bd. I, 
København 1888, pag. 170 or 200).; it seems to me to be a confirmation of the 
view that Æluropus is a climbing animal. It is no doubt connected with the 
tendon of musc. abduc. magnus pollicis and musc. abduc. curtus poll. (Gervais 1875 p. 
86). — The large and heavy animal needs strong muscles, this may be the reason 
why the bone is so extraordinarily large. — The elongation of the tarsale IV—V in 
Ælurus and Æluropus may be due to their supposed semiplantigrade gait (though 
this is somewhat doubtful in Æluropus); it is also elongated in dog and cat. — 
When Lankester & Lydekker say (l. c. pag. 170): “I cannot find evidence of the 
existence of [the] tibial sesamoid in either Procyon or Ursus”, this must be founded 
upon a mistake or upon a defective skeleton, the sesamoid is present, at least in Ursus, 
and nearly as large as that of Æluropus (cfr. fig. 3). 

If Gervais is right in his indication about the number of the vertebræ,
Æluropus has the fewest number of dorsals of any Carnivore, the least otherwise known 
being Mellivora indica with 14 dorsal and 4 lumbar vertebræ (Flower: Osteology, 
pag. 81); but the highest number, 16 and 6, being also found among Mustelidæ 
(Mephitis) much stress cannot be laid on this number in systematical relation. The 
vertebræ of Æluropus seem to be mostly arctoid, those of Ælurus are procyonoidE. Stromer; Die Wirbel der Landraubtieren. (Zoologica, 1902, pag. 135).. 

Unfortunately the soft parts of Æluropus are unknown except the brain, but 
this organ shows, according to Gervais (1870, pag. 136—7 and 141), less resemblance
to that of Ælurus than do the other parts of its body; it differs only in more 
unimportant characters from that of Ursus. 



We may thus say that Æluropus is a true member of the Ursidæ, but developed 
in another direction than Ursus, no doubt from a form related to Hyænarctus and 
indicating on certain accounts a culminating-point of that branch of Ursidæ, whereas 
Ælurus is the culminating-point of the Procyon-Nasua series of Procyonidæ. The 
two forms are converging branches of the same general stem, Arctoidea, but with 
different points of origin on it. They can thus by no means form connecting links 
between Ursidæ and Procyonidæ; this link may (according to Winge) be sought in 
a primitive, Cynodictis-like form.
