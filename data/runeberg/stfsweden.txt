Sweden’s facade is her 2.500 kilometres of coast, facing west, south and
east — the land border towards Norway and Finland consists for the most
part of wastes and mountains. On the extreme south the waves of the
Baltic wash the sandy shores of Scania.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

It is across the sea that run the ways to the continent of Europe and
more distant parts. The Trelleborg ferry carries complete railway trains
across the Baltic.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The Swedes are a sea-faring folk, and even in the grey and shadowy past,
their journeys in quest of trade carried them far beyond the other side
of the Baltic. Thousand-year-old monoliths arranged in the outline of
a ship on the coast at Kåseberga, Scania.</img>
<img><small>Gösta Björklund</small>

The Stockholm »skärgård» is the largest of the many archipelagoes of
tree-clad granite skerries, into which great parts of the coast line dissolve, both
in the east and in the west. Södra Ljusterö.</img>
<img><small>Oscar Halldin</small>

In the outer seaward fringe, the tree-clad islands change to bare islets,
and through labyrinths of rocky shallows craft of all kinds must make
their way along the marked channels. Husaröleden.</img>
<img><small>Artur Nilsson</small>

Where boat-houses and dwellings jostle each other round jetties and
drying-halls in the fishing-places, it is as bare as in the fjelds, but protection is
found from the storms. Bohuslän, Smögen.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Sea-fishing is the chief industry of a great part of the coastal population,
particularly on the west coast. Fishing cutters putting out from Gothenburg.</img>
<img><small>R. Winquist</small>

Poseidon (by Carl Milles), in front of the Art Museum in Gothenburg,
is emblematic of the town’s world-wide shipping and a symbol of the
cultural benefits that Mercury can bestow.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The sea-port of Gothenburg adorns the Swedish coast, not least thanks
to its fine harbour, which extends a safe welcome to vessels under every
flag. Its modern shipbuilding industry, too, awakens justifiable pride.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Thanks to the summer sun, the long expanse of coast from the Koster
islands to the Luleå skerries is one continuous sea-bathing health resort.

Shipping ceases, but the seal hunters set off on their danger-fraught Arctic
expeditions. Kvarken, West Bothnia</img>

Good seamanship is indispensable round the Swedish coast, and not least for
the many pleasure craft. The Sandhamn Regatta. Stockholm Archipelago.</img>

<big><i>From the plains of Scania to the fjelds of Lapland.</i></big>

<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The Swedish soil provides his daily bread for every Swede, but its fertility
is variable. It is in Scania that are found the widest areas of greatest
fertility.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

New ground is laid under the plough every year, but thousands of years
have passed since the first crops were harvested on the great plains. Stone
axes and Roman coins are brought to the light of day, and burial mounds
and »bauta» stones stand erect between the fields, like sacred monuments
to the history of cultivation. Tjärby, Halland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Luxuriant trees, the oak, the lime, the elm and others, find congenial
conditions far up on the Norrland littoral; and in the extreme south, where
the pine-forest has never reigned supreme, the beech flourishes in great,
widespread forests. Beech wood. Tromtö, Blekinge.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The great Västergötland plain, south of Lake Väner, is the largest
plain-land in Central Sweden. Its raised plateau affords a view of a verdant
relief map, with fields and meadows, villages and farms, within the meshes
of the network of roads. View from Billingen, looking northwards.</img>
<img><small>Bengt Åkerblom</small>

The Östergötland plain between Lake Vättern and the Baltic, with wooded
mountains in the north and south, with lakes and bays, small towns rich
in historical associations, churches and castles, with industrial centres, and
a flourishing agriculture, is a genuine Swedish cultural centre with a past
and a future. Kaga village.</img>
<img><small>Gustaf Kullström</small>

The hilly and wooded character of the interior of South Sweden, abounding
in lakes and water-courses, is stamped on the province of Småland, where
tenacious industry forces a reluctant and infecund country to yield
surprising results, perhaps from cottage farming, berrypicking, glass-blowing,
furniture making, or from other industries with names beginning with
small-, by- and home-. A glen at Lyckås.</img>
<img><small>Ulf Bergström</small>

The old-time culture centres in Götaland and Svealand are enframed by
the sea or the great lakes, but also by wayless wilds, with old-world names:
Tiveden, Holaveden, Tylöskogen and Kolmården. Glen at Hult in
Kolmården, Östergötland.</img>
<img><small>Gösta Lundquist</small>

In an undulating part of Central Sweden, where lakes abound, a wooded
range of hills shuts off the view. The fields round the nearest farms peep
out between pasture lands and coppices, which reflect their silhouettes
in the reed-fringed lake. Edsleskog, Dalsland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In districts characterised by large estates, the cultivated areas are grouped
together in larger assemblages than where the country has been cut up by
villages and farmsteads. The avenues and parks, with their heavy masses
of foliage, show the desire of past owners to bring the landscape to conform
to the classical or romantic ideal of beauty. Venngarn, Uppland.</img>
<img><small>Hans Wåhlin</small>

Nearly all the Swedish towns founded before the advent of the railways,
lie by the water. Water affords a cheaper means of communication for
traffic arising out of commerce and industrial life. But there is also a
pleasant side to living by a beautiful shore. Strängnäs, Södermanland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Nearly one-tenth of the surface of Sweden consists of water, and the lakes
— their number exceeds seventy thousand — give its character to the
scenery. Between the leaf-embowered Scanian lakes and the icy
fjeld-waters there is a rich scale of varying features, from the luxuriant to the
barren, from the idyllic to the majestic. Ämmelången, Närke.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The Göta Canal, the 240-mile-long water route Gothenburg — Lake Väner
— Lake Vätter — Baltic Sea, was completed in 1832, during the first
decade of the steam boats. It was the midnight sun in Lappland and this
beautiful traffic route that first tempted tourists to Sweden — and
continues to do so today. Locks at Trollhättan, Västergötland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In »Bergslagen», where the pine forests supplied charcoal, the waterfalls
provided power, and the water system of rivers and lakes afforded
transport possibilities, the scattered smelting-houses and hammers have been
succeeded by great industrial complexes. But the memories of past glories,
often revived, still linger about the place names, and the old associations
still breathe through the industrialized areas. Brevens bruk, Närke.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The pine forest areas of North Sweden, running down beyond
»Bergslagen», embrace also small towns and industrial centres, which lie, not
always on the open plains, but sometimes on the fringes of the wilds, or
where the valleys narrow between the mountains. Filipstad, Värmland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In the depths of the northern forest regions, as too in the southern
uplands, the tilled fields run in narrow strips along the river valleys or
form bright patches on the shores of the lakes. Brunskog, Värmland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Broadly speaking, the Norrland terrain forms a long and extended slope,
from the fjelds down to the eastern coast. Here it meets the ancient
sea-bottom, now river valleys and wide plains, where agriculture has the same
spacious scope as it has farther south. Kungsberg, Gästrikland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The river has shaped the valley and called the country-side to life. Where
formerly the village ferry plied, now stands a modern bridge, on to which
converge well-made roads, and a power station rises, which turns to
account the waters of the neighbouring rapids and distributes light and
power to the farmsteads. Indalsälven at Ragunda, Jämtland.</img>
<img><small>Yngve Christiernsson</small>

Below the lake-studded fjeld regions, extends the forest country,
intersected by mighty rivers, whose dark waters are flecked with foam, and on
whose bosoms the forest timber picks out scanty patterns. Ångermanälven
at Österåsen, Ångermanland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In the agricultural districts of Norrland the farmsteads vie in size with
manor houses, for even though the tillage is small, timber abounds, and
there is no lack of space for dwellings. The crops are dried on giant
drying-hurdles, and there is room in the cart-shed for both wheeled
vehicles and sledges. Koddis, Västerbotten.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The snow-topped fjelds can be seen from the capital of the province of
Jämtland. Grandiose nature and the creations of the hand of man are
associated here in a landscape without its match in Sweden. Östersund.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Even far up in the valleys of the fjelds, the short, but nightless summer
ripens the crops and the cut shocks dot the fields lying between the fringes
of the spruce forests and the shores of the lakes. Below Sonfjället, Härjedalen.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

At the shiellings — the summer colonies of the highest-lying agricultural
lands in the remote forest regions — the white, hornless fjeld cattle find
abundant pasturage, and crops of wild hay are borne down to the villages
on the bosom of the first snows of winter. At Drommen, Jämtland.</img>
<img><small>Gunnar Öhrn</small>

Up in the fjeld wilds the nomad Lapp and his reindeer are as inherent
in the scenery as the flowers of the field and the untamed animals. To
him the beauty of the landscape lies in the quality of the pasturage. At
Sitoätno, Sarek, Lappland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The winter storms sweep the snow as in foaming torrents down the lee
faces of the fjelds, and the frozen masses become packed together into
a fantasticly shaped coat of mail, which hides and yet reveals the irregular
contours beneath. Helagsstöten, Härjedalen.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The fjelds in their summer raiment — salix and glacier crowfoot nestling
by the snowdrifts, birchwoods and luxuriant verdure high up on the slopes,
grass rising to man’s height in the dells, and everywhere, absorbed in
the duties of parenthood, birds of passage returned from Africa and South
Europe — are a miracle to those who have seen them as impenetrable
masses of winter snow. Karnjelapakte, Lappland.</img>
<img><small>Runo Lindkvist</small>

Among the fjelds extends a descending chain of deep lakes, connected by
rushing rivers. From Kårtjejaure to the far-flung Langas, the masses of
water hurl themselves over the rocky ledges of the steeps, forming one
of the mightiest waterfalls in Europe, Stora Sjöfallet, Lappland.</img>
<img><small>Gösta Lundquist</small>

On the watersheds of the great Norrland rivers, their tributaries meet up
in the fjelds themselves. Rapids in R. Ume, 350 kilometres as the crow
flies from its outflow into the Gulf of Bothnia, Lappland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The snow masses up in the fjelds pack themselves together into mighty
glaciers. These are the last remnants of the great ice-cap which once
extended far down over the continent of Europe. Kebnepakte glacier, fissure
and an iceberg in Lake Tarfala, Lappland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Thanks to the Swedish Touring Ciub’s establishments in various regions
in the Swedish fjelds, both summer and winter excursions can be made in
the high fjelds. In spite of the enormous distances, there is no need of
elaborate equipment or long delays. The top of Lillsylen, Jämtland.</img>
<img><small>Gösta Lundquist</small>

A fjeld landscape under the sun of high summer, with majestic clouds
sailing among the peaks, suggests the Creation of the Bible, with the earth’s
crust just freed of the water on the First Day and still steaming from
the radiance of a new-kindled sun. Sarek, Lappland.</img>

<big><i>Natural resources.</i></big>

Through the exploations of the rich ore finds in Norrbotten, Sweden has
again become the iron-producing country it was in bygone days, but
with the centre shifted from the old province of Bergslagen to the wilds
of Lapland, north of the Polar Circle. Work by artificial light at Kiruna.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The rich Norrbotten ore is principally quarried by means of blasting,
terrace by terrace. Whole mountain spurs consist of metalliferous rock.
Ore scoop at Kiruna.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

A generation ago the problem of transporting the iron-ore of North
Sweden to the markets of the world, where it is now of dominating
importance, was solved by the construction of the Riksgräns railway, running
to the port of Narvik on the Atlantic and to Luleå on the Baltic.

<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Since the middle of the 1920’s Boliden has been — as Falu was of old —
incomparably the most important name connected with the mining industry
of Sweden. With the aid of new methods of prospecting, rich finds of
gold, copper and silver have been mined on a large scale round the lower
reaches of the Skellefte River. Quarry in the Boliden mine, West Bothnia.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In the Rönnskär smelting works by the Skellefte harbour, down to which
the mine railway carries a daily ration of a thousand tons, the Boliden ore
undergoes the many and various processes which yield an abundance of
sulphur and arsenic, in addition to copper and the precious metals.

<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

On the extensive and well-husbanded pine-forests of Sweden are based
nearly half the exports of the country. They afford work of all kinds,
from the winter fellling and hauling in the distant forest regions to the
working-up of final products. Älvdalen, Dalarna.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The forest industry has its own methods of transport, carefully utilising
the river system, from their smallest ramifications right down to the sea.
After the break-up of the ice, the piled-up logs come to life; then comes
the hazardous spring and summer work of keeping the whole course of the
floating-ways clear, right down to the mouths of the rivers. 
Älvdalen, Dalarna.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Saw-mills and pulp mills receive the timber at the mouths of the rivers,
and, after the appropriate mechanical or chemical treatment, the products
are shipped to consumers within the building and paper industries all over
the world. The Swedish cellulose industry is only surpassed in magnitude
by that of the United States. A timber complex at Karskär, Gästrikland.</img>
<img><small>Ture Rydberg</small>

Mountain and forest products could not be utilised to such an enormous
extent as they are now, if the third of the great Swedish natural resources,
water power, was not available in such abundance. The State power works
at Porjus, the power station for the ore-fields and the Riksgräns railway,
is remarkable by reason of its semi-Arctic situation and of its machine
hall, constructed deep down in the rock. Porjus, Lapland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The main railway lines, industry, and the towns, are the great consumers
of electric energy, but even the smallest waterways are utilised to supply
water-power — »white coal» — to hundreds of places, large and small.

<img><small>Peter Mygind</small>

The first Swedish settlers — a hunting and fishing Polar people — followed
in the tracks of the receding inland ice about fifteen thousand years ago.

<img><small>V. Lundgren</small>

Even during the Stone Age the Swedes attained such a stage of civilisation
that their imagination developed a figurative language. The advanced
civilisation of the Bronze Age in particular is recorded in remarkable rock-carvings, 
which depict human beings, animals and implements, but above all ships.</img>
<img><small>C.-J. Anrick</small>

Practically every parish in Sweden can exhibit examples of the cultural
development of prehistoric ages in the form of ancient relics. The graves
— with their deposits of furniture and their external structure — yield the
most important contributions. Monoliths arranged in the outline of a ship,
and burial mounds near Anundshögen in Badelunda, Västmanland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

In the Uppsala tumuli lie the first Swedish kings whose names are known,
from the 6th century, and close by them, on the sacred place of sacrifice of
the Sveas, the Archbishop’s church, part of the walls of which still remain
in Gamla Uppsala church, was built in the 12th century, on the site of an
earlier wooden temple.</img>
<img><small>H. Faith-Ell</small>

The many rune-stones from the Viking times show how the Graeco-Roman
alphabet was changed in the course of its slow migration towards the
north into the clumsy characters exhibited on the stones. The terse sentences
left on the stones by the chisels of the rune-writers represent the oldest
literature of Sweden. A rune-stone at Uringe, Grödinge, Södermanland.</img>
<img><small>Oscar Halldin</small>

The earliest town in Sweden was Birka, situated on an island in Lake
Mälar. Birka was laid waste, and Sigtuna, lying but a few miles south
of the heathen Uppsala, succeeded it as the centre of trade and the cradle
of Christianity. Its church ruins, dating from the 11th century, are relics
of the time when the religion of the East and the culture of the West
found a firm foothold in the heart of the kingdom of the Sveas.</img>
<img><small>Folke Högberg</small>

It was not only a new religion that the Roman church introduced; new
ways of life and new ideals of culture made their appearance, spreading
chiefly from monastic foundations, and the architecture of the foreign
mother-houses was quickly reproduced in Sweden. Cistercian church from
the 13th century, at Varnhem, Västergötland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The Christianized Swedish peasantry built their parish churches, but for
the rest preserved the characteristic sturdy freedom of the social system of
their fathers, which neither Pope, King nor country magnate could shake.

native timber architecture.</img>
<img><small>Ragnar Lundin</small>

Medieval religious life in Sweden found its most reverent national
expression within the Order of Saint Birgitta (1303—1373), whose mother-church
at Vadstena, in Östergötland, was erected in conformity with the planning
of the foundress. Vadstena Abbey, Östergötland.</img>
<img><small>Th. Wåhlin</small>

The high ideals of the age, which found expression in western Romanesque
and Gothic ecclesiastical art, are reflected in Sweden in many medieval
buildings and objects d’art, which enriched for all time the ancient heritage
with priceless relics of the past. Ornamental clock in Lund Cathedral.</img>
<img><small>Anders Roland</small>

On the richly fertile island of Gothland, the 93 parish churches and the
16 town churches have been cared for with unique artistic solicitude, which
is the more remarkable as the many architectonic and sculptural masterpieces 
on the island are chiefly the work of native Gothlanders. Endre church.</img>
<img><small>G. Reimers</small>

Visby, which has preserved its medival character through half a millennium, 
is a microcosm of the contribution of the Gothlanders to cultural
development in the North. Long before the birth of Christ, they carried on
extensive foreign trade, and at the beginning of the Middle Ages the town
of Visby grew up round the safe harbour on the west coast, and there
colonies of foreign traders found their favourite settling-place.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

During the 13th century the citizens of Visby built and fortified their great
town wall, three kilometres of which stand to this day, and which was a
redoubtable defence for many generations. But in 1361 arrived the Danish
king with a great army, devastated the country, destroyed the peasant
forces, and breached the wall. With that the island and its town lost their
prominent position for all time.</img>
<img><small>Eric Trulson</small>

From olden times the episcopal cities had been the chief centres of spiritual
culture. After the reforms of the 16th century, the gymnasia (higher
schools) became the educational centres appropriate to the new age. The
first one was founded in Västerås in 1620, under the direction of Bishop
Johannes Rudbeckius, to whom a statue by Milles has been raised in the
shadow of the cathedral tower.</img>
<img><small>Nils Moosberg</small>

The oldest Swedish university was founded at Uppsala in 1477 by Bishop
Jakob Ulfsson. At the beginning of the 17th century, Gustavus II
Adolphus extended and safeguarded its activities by means of large
endowments. The King’s own education had been entrusted to the Uppsala
professor Johan Skytte, who bequeathed his house to support a chair of
rhetoric. »Skytteanum», Uppsala.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Ystad, on the south coast of Scania, with its winding streets and its
venerable half-timbered houses, provides a living picture of an old-time
urban community, with its handicrafts and commerce, taverns and inns,
where the rhythm of working life was regulated by market-days and fairs.</img>
<img><small>Stadsark. kont., Kalmar</small>

Kalmar, on the east coast of Småland, preserves, as does Visby, the memory
of a walled medieval town. The turreted stronghold, the proud Kalmar
Castle, still remains; but at the end of the 17th century the entire town
was removed to a nearby island, and church, town-hall and houses were
rebuilt within new defences. Ramparts, bastions and gates — the
»Cavalier» is shown here — still give the town its own special character.</img>
<img><small>Oscar Halldin</small>

Statesmen and warriors of the far-flung realm of the Sweden of the 17th
century built, for their days of ease, large country-houses of appropriate
but sober splendour. Tidö, the home of Axel Oxenstierna, the Chancellor,
in Västmanland.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Läckö Castle in Västergötland, on the shores of Lake Väner, is one of the
proud memorials from the Period of Greatness, whose days of glory were
few, the owners being compelled to renounce their possessions and
privileges for the good of the State. The castle has now been officially scheduled
as an ancient monument and opened to visitors.</img>
<img><small>Planting-Bergloo</small>

Skokloster, in Uppland, still shows in detail how the Swedish generals of
the Thirty Years War and their descendants built and lived. A walk
through the apartments, armouries, and libraries, carries the visitor back
to the almost unchanged home of a magnate of the 17th century. Vestibule
on the ground floor.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

Gripsholm, Gustavus Vasa’s massive Renaissance castle on the Södermanland 
shore of Lake Mälar was, at the end of the 18th century, the centre
of the cultured court life fostered by Gustavus III. In one of the round
towers of the castle he created this proscenium for the French — and
Swedish — dramatic art that he so ardently promoted and encouraged.</img>
<img><small>Nils Åzelius</small>

Linné, the clergyman’s son from Småland, who became Sweden’s most
famed scientist, gathered round his professorial chair at Uppsala a following
of disciples from far and near. He also welcomed them to his country
home at Hammarby, which has been piously preserved, and which still
today attracts pilgrims from afar to admire the natural beauties of the place.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The many country houses and manses, even in the remote countryside,
have their memories of the great contributions to culture made by
generations now past and gone. On the stone in front of Ransäter, 
in Värmland, is graven the name of Geijer, the great historian and poet.</img>
<img><small>Olof Ekberg</small>

The maypole, here shown in a Leksand village in Dalecarlia, is raised
on Midsummer Eve throughout the country, and is a beautiful symbol of
the youthful <i>joie de vivre</i> of the Swedish people. At the same time it
is a tribute to ancient custom and testifies to the Swedish loyalty to
inherited tradition.</img>

An oasis in the life and bustle of a modern town, Skansen, Arthur Hazelius’ 
remarkable creation, presents an idyllic picture of the rapidly passing
distinctive folk-cultures in the different provinces. Buildings in

Stockholm emerges in history as the successor to Birka and Sigtuna,
carefully cherished by Birger Jarl in the middle of the 13th century. The seat
of his royal castle, the town was to be the key of Lake Mälar. To its
favourable position, where highways and waterways intersected, was due
its subsequent development. At the end of the 17th century the old
stronghold was replaced by the present castle.</img>
<img><small>K. O. Sjöström</small>

Riddarholm Church, the ancient church of the Franciscans, is a venerable
relic of medieval Stockholm. After the death of Gustavus II Adolphus,
however, it became a royal mausoleum, and as, during the Period of
Greatness, new houses of brick and stone sprang up round it, the church,
as the picture shows, was adorned with vaults and side-chapels in the
Renaissance and Baroque styles.</img>
<img><small>Bertil Norberg</small>

The royal Palace of Stockholm, the masterpiece of Nicodemus Tessin
the Younger, is the royal residence still today. The ceremonial opening
of the Riksdag (Parliament) takes place in the Palace Church, in the
Council Chamber the King holds Cabinet Councils, and as of yore the
old State Apartments still witness brilliant Court festivities.</img>
<img><small>C. G. Rosenberg</small>

The finest of the royal summer residences is the palace of Drottningholm,
immediately west of Stockholm. It is a well-preserved Swedish Versailles,
with wings and pavilions and extensive grounds, which afford an idea of
the artistic standard attained in Sweden during the 17th and 18th centuries.</img>
<img><small>Oscar Halldin</small>

The City Hall, designed by the architect Ragnar Östberg, is the finest 20th
century monumental building in Stockholm. The municipal administration
of the city finds accommodation there, side by side with the richly

Stockholm is considered a beautiful town, and the chief reason is probably
its position on wooded islands and rocky peninsulas. But the buildings, too,
both young and old, exhibit grace and beauty. View from a picturesque old
suburb in the »South», above Riddarfjärden looking towards the City Hall.</img>

Stockholm at work. Her industries, handicrafts and commerce do not
only supply the needs of the 600,000 Stockholmers. The city is the most
important meeting point for the traffic of the country, and through it
passes a considerable part of both the home and the foreign trade.

Working Stockholm exhibits a modern façade, and not without reason, for
modern technical and organisatory aids and appliances are in great favour
with the industrial and mercantile enterprises situated in any of the streets
in »Klara» and »Jacob» — two of the parishes in the city.

In the summer, Stockholm is the chief tourist resort in Sweden. From
every quarter the travelling Swedes throng to their beautiful and hospitable
capital, and the foreign tourist boats make their way thither through the
wonderful skerries. Of a truth Stockholm is not only a worthy goal for
the tourist, but also a splendid point of departure for those who desire
to make the closer acquaintance of Sweden.</img>
