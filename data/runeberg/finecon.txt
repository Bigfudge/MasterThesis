<chapter name="I. Peculiarities of the Finnish Civilisation">
<h1>FINLAND</h1>

<h2><small>CHAPTER I</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>PECULIARITIES OF FINNISH CIVILISATION</small></small></h2>

<sc>According</sc> to Aristotle, the strongest nations and
those best fitted for freedom and independence are
the agricultural races of the North. The most
northerly civilised country in the world, with the
exception of parts of Sweden and Norway, is Finland,
and three-quarters of its population live by
agricultural pursuits. Hungary has a slightly larger rural
population, with fewer people in the cities; but no
other country has a larger population dependent on
agriculture.

At first the tropical countries of the East showed
more rapid development; later on civilisation passed
to the milder climate of the Mediterranean. The
human race was not yet strong enough to overcome
the difficulties of a northern climate. When this
occurred, it was in Western Europe that the highest
form of civilisation was developed. At present the
highest stage of all has been reached in England and
the United States. Nevertheless, in early times the
Scandinavian race played a great part in this
development. In the latter part of the ninth century,
when the other Teutonic races were becoming to some
extent less hardy under the influence of the Christian
religion and of a more or less centralised Roman
government, the Scandinavians conquered and
occupied more than half of England, the islands and
part of the coast of Scotland, and the harbours
and adjacent country in Ireland. They founded a
remarkable colony in Iceland, whence, later,
Greenland and certain coasts of North America (“Vinland
the good,” as it is called in Icelandic books) were
discovered. From Sweden, Scandinavian warriors
founded and ruled the states which later developed
into the Russian Empire, whence their fleets went
down to Constantinople and the Caspian Sea; while
at the same time other fleets were descending on the
Spanish peninsula, Morocco, and other Mediterranean
countries. Indeed the Scandinavian race, always
strong in its freedom, became almost irresistible when
it had learnt the arts of more modern warfare from
the nations with whom it came into contact. Their
most remarkable contribution to mediaeval
civilisation was Normandy, the colony which they finally
formed, after much devastation, and some other more
short-lived settlements, on the coast of France. The
Franco-Norman descendants of these colonists not only
conquered England, crossed over to Ireland, and
organised Scotland, but also, after founding
highly-civilised kingdoms in Southern Italy and Sicily, and
thence making further conquests in the Balkan
peninsula, in Africa, and even in Asia Minor, were the
leaders in the greatest and most wonderful movement
of mediæval times, the Crusades.

About a hundred years before the first Scandinavians
spread westwards, the Finns had moved into what is
now known as Finland. They came from the heart
of Russia, where they had been settled north of the
central Volga. There were two tribes, differing in
physical appearance and mental qualities; one, the
slightly darker and more vivacious Carelians of
Eastern Finland and of the adjoining parts of Russia
as far north as the Gulf of Bothnia; the other the
lighter-haired and square-set Tavasts of the west. Living
in the south-west corner of Finland were the Finns
proper (<i>egentliga Finnar</i>), who were closely connected
with the Tavasts. More or less related to these tribes
were some other Ural-Altaic tribes, who remained in
the interior of Russia, and also some tribes who
advanced simultaneously with these others towards the
Baltic — the Coures and Lives (who were related to the
Carelians), and the Esthonians (who were related to
the Tavasts and Finns proper). It has been suggested
that the Kajans (<i>Kainulaiset</i> in Finnish, <i>Kvæns</i> in
Norwegian; they are described by Othere, the
Norwegian skipper sent northwards to explore by Alfred
the Great) were another Finnish tribe living in the
country, according to the commonly accepted view,
before the coming of the Carelians and Tavasts. The
name of these Kvæns, which resembles the Swedish
“kvinna,” the Danish-Norwegian “kvinde” or “kvind,”
and the English “queen,” has given rise to numerous
myths about a northern nation consisting of Amazons,
or at least always governed by a woman. We certainly
find this tale several hundreds of years earlier in
Tacitus. These Kvæns are now generally supposed
to be identical with the Biarmians (the modern
“Permiens”), familiar in the old sagas, and either
Carelians, or related to the Carelians.

Long before these migrations took place, it is certain
that southern Finland was inhabited. On the coast,
and on the navigable rivers, and on that part of the
Bothnian coast which is now inhabited by Swedes, we
find numerous antiquities of the same kind as are
found in western Europe, especially in Scandinavian
countries. Many belong to the Later Stone Age, a few
belong to the Bronze Age, and a large number to the
successive Iron Ages. The most eminent antiquarian
authorities have now to some extent modified their old
theory of successive immigrations, in which an entire
people, using stone implements, was replaced by a
population using bronze; or they believe at least that for
some thousands of years before Christ a Teutonic race
inhabited parts of Germany and the greater part of
Scandinavia. It is probable that antiquities, found chiefly
in south-western Finland and on the chain of islands
which connect Finland with Sweden, really belong to an
old Scandinavian race. The Swedish authors Montelius
and Wiklund believe that such a race actually lived
here two thousand years before Christ. Stone
implements, belonging to the Laplanders, some of them of
a very recent period, have been found in the interior
of Finland; but these differ in character from those
found in the coast districts. Again, on the coast east
of the river Kymmene, the Stone Age, which lasted
much longer in that region, is supposed to indicate a
Finnish race. Moreover, while a large number of
words of Teutonic origin, found in varying numbers in
the different Western-Finnish languages, are to some
extent borrowed from the Goths (so that it is obvious
that somewhere the Finns have been in close relation
with the Goths), yet the greater part have been adopted
into the Finnish language from the Scandinavian,
before the latter was divided into separate languages.
Montelius and Wiklund think it possible, and even
probable, that such a contact between the
Scandinavians and the Finnish tribes took place in
southern Finland. It must be admitted, however, that
the truth about these prehistoric populations is not
quite clear. We can only guess that part of the
present Scandinavian population of Finland is
descended from Scandinavians who were there some
thousand years before the Finns arrived. What is
certain is that some Finnish tribes were here about
A.D. 700.

While the Tavasts and Carelians did not differ
greatly at first, and soon amalgamated in certain parts
of the country, the Lapps or Laplanders remained
an entirely separate race. Their language resembles
Finnish, as it does other Ural-Altaic languages; but
they themselves are totally different in physical
appearance, mental development, and manner of life. They
seem to have got their language from their more
civilised neighbours. They are Arctic nomads; while
the Finns, even when they first came into the country,
had domestic animals and some knowledge of
agriculture, as may be seen in their old national epics, the
Kalevala. The Lapps came early into the country,
and at a later period were to be found in the interior;
but they invariably retired northwards when the Finns
advanced, and rarely amalgamated with them in any
way. In modern times the Lapps are more settled —
though exclusively in the north — and often take
service with the Finns, so that more admixture takes
place; but the total Lapp population in Finland is
only about one thousand, and most of the reindeer
(formerly almost exclusively the property of the
Laplanders) belong now to the Finns. Only a small number
of Lapps continue to move about with these animals,
which are admirably adapted to this northern climate.
The Gipsies of Finland are more numerous than the
Lapps, but less amenable to control; they came from
Sweden in the sixteenth century, and now number nearly
two thousand. In modern Sweden they hardly exist,
and their wanderings in the remote eastern districts of
Finland testify to the backwardness and superstition
prevailing in that part of the country.

It was the last period of the Crusades which
introduced Swedish culture into Finland. In 1006, Olaf
Haraldson — St. Olaf, later on a king and popular saint
of Norway — was in southern Finland; and St. Olaf’s
Saga speaks of old Swedish kings who had power in
Finland and Carelia (“Kyrialand”). The “law-man”
Thorgny tells Oluf Skötkonung that the men of
Sweden would gladly accompany him to the East, if
he would follow the example of his ancestors and go
there instead of harrying the Norwegians. Oluf’s
daughter Ingegjerd is finally married to Jaroslav of
Russia, and obtains as a dowry Ingermanland, which
is governed in her name by her foster-father, Jarl
Ragnvald of Westgötland, the friend of the Norwegians. 
The stories about the crusade of King Erik
the Saint, Jedvardson, Jarl Guttorm (the same name
as that of the Danish King Godorm or Gudrum in
England), and of Bishop Henrik (an Englishman by
birth) to Finland proper, and particularly to the district
of Åbo, may be for the most part only a legend.
There is a story that, after the visit of the Papal
legate, Nicholas of Albano, to Sweden, Henrik went
over to Finland, where he was killed the following
year (1158), and that after him Bishop Rodulf was
taken prisoner and killed by the Carelians in 1178.
At all events, Birger Jarl went a hundred years later
into Tavastland, where he built the castle of Tavastehus. 
A little later, in 1293, the Marsk (or Marshal)
of Sweden, Torgils Knutson, sailed round to Carelia,
whose people had already established communication
with Novgorod; and there he built the castle of
Viborg, where it is said that fourteen Carelian
“gislalag” or village-communities submitted to him.
This is supposed to indicate that the Finns had some
political organisation, though not precisely the “härads”
or “hundreds” of the Scandinavians. Already, before
this, the English-born Bishop Thomas had been in the
country, and is said to have proposed the formation of
Finland into a separate principality under the Pope,
in the same manner as some other ecclesiastical
states further down the eastern coast of the Baltic.
Thomas is said to have built the cathedral of Åbo,
but to have given up his see in 1245. His
successors Bero or Biörn, Ragvald or Ragnvald, and
Catillus or Ketil, bear names which are familiar in the
Danish-Norwegian conquest of Northern England and
Ireland, as well as among the Norman chiefs in
northern and central France. During the same period
the Danish kings carried a crusade into Esthonia, on
the other side of the Gulf of Finland, and conquered
the Finnish tribes who were settled there.

The conversion of the Finns, like all other conversions 
in those days, was chiefly effected by the sword;
but there was one great difference between this
conquest and those made by the Crusaders in the East, or
in north-eastern Germany, or in the Baltic provinces
of Russia. This difference lay in the fact that the
Swedes were a nation composed of freemen only; like
the Danes in northern England three centuries earlier,
they were all free cultivators of the soil, and the
freedom of the peasants or agricultural population was
from the first the basis of the social system in Finland,
as it was in all Scandinavian countries. On the other
hand, the social ideas of the Normans from Normandy
and southern Italy had been largely influenced by
France and by other countries dominated by the
Roman law and by mixed Roman and Teutonic 
institutions; therefore the Normans took possession of
new territories as feudal lords.

Another peculiarity of the conversion of Finland
was due to the differences in language. It has been
said that the Swedes ought to have amalgamated
with the Finns, as the Normans after coming to
England amalgamated with the English and Danes.
There was, however, this great difference; that the
Swedes were not (like the Normans and the Danes in
England) a nationality closely connected in race and
language with the people whose country they had
conquered; they can better be compared with
Norwegians and Danes or, later on, Normans and English
in their relation to the Celtic population of Ireland, or
with Frenchmen in Alsace or Belgium. So great was
the difference that there was no possibility of a
language common to all, as in England. Not only did
the upper class generally speak two languages, but an
entirely distinct Swedish population was settled on
the coast of the Gulf of Finland in Southern Nyland,
from the Kymmene River westwards, and in Finland
proper as far as where the mountain-chain separates
the southern coast from the west, and on the groups
of islands known as the “skärgård.” On the other
hand, the western coast of Finland proper has a
population chiefly Finnish; while again on the lower
and more fertile coasts of Southern Ostrobothnia, as
far north as Gamla-Karleby, there is a large Swedish
population. The total number of Swedish inhabitants
of Finland amounts to nearly one-seventh of the whole
population. The Swedes on the southern coast may,
like those on the other side of the Gulf of Finland —
on the islands of Dagö and Runö, for instance — have
come there much earlier than the dates mentioned
above; and according to the last researches, even
before 400 B.C., at which date the Swedes were,
until recently, supposed to have come over to Svealand.
Scandinavian merchant-warriors may even have had
dealings with the Finns a long time before the Finns
came into Finland, a supposition borne out by the
number of words relating to domestic economy which
the Finns have borrowed from the original Scandinavian 
language. Some of the Swedes in Ostrobothnia
evidently came later from different parts of Sweden;
finally there was a considerable amount of change and
re-settlement on account of war, pestilence, and famine.
The preservation of the Swedish tongue among the
upper classes (who, however, also speak Finnish) has
certain disadvantages; but it has this enormous
advantage, that the Finnish nation, unlike all other
Ural-Altaic people except the Hungarians, has thereby
participated in western culture. Not only did the
Finns share in Swedish freedom, but together with
the Swedes they adopted the religious reformation of
the sixteenth century, receiving the education of the
reformed church, whose schooling has brought about
a better understanding of personal responsibility,
individual rights, justice, and humanity. It cannot be
denied that the nations which did not accept this
change, but remained part of the Roman Catholic
Church, or of the Greek Orthodox Church with its
dead Byzantine forms, have lagged behind in this
respect. The upper classes in Finland, like the
relatively cosmopolitan Swedes, were also greatly
influenced by the period of free-thought and the zeal
for national reform and development which marked
the close of the eighteenth century.

The crusades, which brought the Finns into the
circle of civilised nations, came late. Putting aside
the Kvæns in Northern Ostrobothnia, the first Finns,
Tavasts as well as Carelians, had only occupied the
southern coast, including Southern Tavastland, and,
generally speaking, the valleys of the great rivers, the
Vuoksi (which flows into the Ladoga Lake), the
Kymmene (which flows into the Gulf of Finland), and the
Kumo (which flows into the Gulf of Bothnia). We
find evidence that there were formerly more farms
and villages in these districts than at present. Up
to a relatively late date there were no settlements
beyond the region of the great inland lakes which are
found in the southern part of the country. They had
extended no farther than Savolaks, the district
comprising the islands in the enormous Lake of Saima and
other neighbouring lakes, the islands on the Bothnian
coast as far as Western Satakunta (a name which
means “the hundred townships”) and those on the
coast north of this country. The Swedes had settled
here after the crusades, and the mediæval “Stora Rim
Chrönikan” (Great Rhymed Chronicle), speaking of
the Crusades of Birger Jarl, in 1249, says: “They
put into the country Christian men; where I expect
they still remain.” In these parts we meet the same
geographical names as in Sweden, Denmark, and
Danish England, such as Ulfsby, Carleby, and others.
On the other hand, Northern Tavastland, Eastern
Satakunta, and the interior of Ostrobothnia, were colonised
at a much later date. In Northern Carelia the scanty
population was more closely connected with the
Russian principality of Novgorod. In the year 1500
there was only one Greek church built in these parts;
at that time, and far into the sixteenth century,
paganism still existed. For some time there was
raiding and fighting between the Tavasts and Carelians,
and these latter suffered also from the Russians, who
were then under the suzerainty of the Mongolian
Khans. In the middle of the fourteenth century,
King Magnus Erikson began serious negotiations with
the Pope and his legate with regard to a general
crusade against the Russians. In 1475, at the time
of the Scandinavian Union, the great Danish-Swedish
chief, Erik Axelson Thott, built the castle of Olofsborg
(now the centre of the town of Nyslott) on a little
island in Savolaks; and in 1605 the country still
farther north was made secure by the building of the
castle of Kajaneborg, also situated on an islet in the
middle of some rapids near the great Uleå Lake. It
was characteristic of these days, as late as into the
fifteenth century, that the kings had left the whole
government of the northern part of Sweden and
Finland in the hands of guilds of traders (“Birkarlar,”
possibly derived from the word “by,” meaning “town”),
who lived in towns on the coast. The old kings not
only left in their hands all trade with the Lapps, then
wandering far southwards, but also permitted Lapps to
be distributed among the different guilds of Birkarlar
who had a right to tax them; the Birkarlar
themselves, on their part, paying to the Crown a moderate
tax, consisting of a few skins. At the time of the
Reformation there were in all Finland only 141
parishes, and only a very few in the immense
northeastern part of the country. At present there are
366; the parishes of Finland being much larger in
extent and population than those in other
Scandinavian countries.

A glance at the figures of the population show how
tardy was the colonisation of the country. Even at
the beginning of this century it was only the
southernmost coast and the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia which
were well populated. A coloured map, showing the
density of the population, would be relatively dark just
there, and very lightly shaded everywhere else. After
the present Russian frontier-line had been definitely
settled by Gustavus Adolphus at the peace of Stolbova
in 1617 (it was drawn across the watershed in the
deserted eastern forests), war continued to decimate
the population, first because they sent contingents to
the victorious armies of Sweden, and later when they
were defeated and their country devastated by Russia.
After the “Great War” with Peter the Great, which
was concluded in 1721, the population had been
reduced by one-half and now numbered only between
200,000 and 250,000. In the middle of the century,
at the end of the “Little War” with Russia, it was
not much more than 400,000; or, including the part
of Finland then ceded to Russia as a result of the war,
at all events under 500,000; which is one-fifth of the
present population. After these wars, thousands of
villages were deserted; sometimes, as in 1721, only
old men, women, and children being left. After such
periods, it is true, marriages and births increased
considerably. In 1790, at the conclusion of another war,
the country had a population not exceeding 800,000,
or a third of its present number.

It was not war only which reduced the population.
The country suffered periodically from famine and its
consequent diseases, as well as from the Great Plague
common to other parts of Europe. In 1509, there
was an appalling famine, another extending over two
years occurred in the middle of the seventeenth century,
and others towards the end of the seventeenth century,
in 1693 and in 1695-7. In three years a third of the
population died. In 1710 the plague destroyed whole
villages. In 1723, 1726, 1727, and 1731, after the
Great War, there were again terrible famines. During
the twelve months between September 1796 and
1797, more than 100,000 people died. Severe frosts
and consequent destruction of the crops occurred in
1856, 1862, and 1867, when the population in one
year decreased by 100,000 souls. It is especially
during the month of August that frost destroys the
growing crops. When the hoar-frost melts away on
sunny mornings, corn and vegetables are killed in
large quantities. Now, however, not only are these
frosts less frequent — owing to the bogs and marshes,
where the frost-fogs linger, having been drained — but
with the extension of railway and other communication
it is easier to bring relief in the famine-periods. The
people themselves have other provision for famine
years. Such occupations as tree-felling and
forest-work generally bring a certain amount of income,
especially in the northern districts, so that the
precarious profits of agriculture are of less vital
importance. Finally, the great development of dairy-farming
makes the people less dependent on the cultivation of
grain.

Notwithstanding the frequent frosts, the climate of
Finland cannot be called unfavourable to agriculture.
This is due to the Gulf Stream, which mitigates the
rigour of the climate, though not to the same extent
as on the Norwegian coast. Finland is also surrounded
by the Gulf of Bothnia, the Gulf of Finland, and the
Lake of Ladoga, three great reservoirs which retain the
warmth of summer far on into the autumn. The
whole country slopes to the south-west, which leaves
it exposed mainly to the warmer winds. There is, of
course, a great difference in the climate in different
parts of the country. “When it is time for strawberries 
to be in flower in Tammerfors, the Lapps are
driving in sledges.” At Helsingfors the longest day and
the longest night are not more than 18½ hours, which
is not very different from the rest of Europe. At
Uleåborg they are 22 hours, and in the northern part
of the Lapmark they are two or three months. In the
far north the concentrated light and heat of the long
days enable barley to mature in from six weeks’ to two
months’ time.

Now when peace has reigned for a long period;
when the country has had a relatively good and for
the last generation even an excellent government;
when science and intelligence have begun to surmount
the difficulties of nature; the progress and the increase
of production and wealth in Finland are really
wonderful. The average crops are double what they were a
generation ago. The export of butter has increased
to 30 million (Finnish) marks, and of wood to 100
millions; and statistics show an export of 18 million
marks’ worth of cellulose and pulp for paper. Wages are
still very low in some parts of the country, but in other
parts they have more than doubled, and are sometimes
as high as in America. The number of paupers in receipt
of relief has decreased in eight years from 110,000 to
68,000, partly owing to reformed poor-law administration, 
but largely owing to economic progress.
According to the figures of the income-tax in towns,
small incomes have increased faster than large ones,
and the people live in much greater comfort than
formerly. Bread mixed with pine-bark and chopped
straw, which was once an ordinary article of food in
bad years and was generally eaten in some parts of
the country, is now no longer common. The ordinary
fare of the peasants is still very poor, consisting of
rye-bread baked twice a year, sour whey, sour milk, and
salt fish; the result of which diet is catarrh of the
stomach, whose most familiar symptom is the sallow
complexion so often visible in the country. But in
this respect, too, there is great improvement.
Commerce in general is showing a most remarkable rate of
progress. In a few years the import and exports have
doubled. In the matter of foreign trade, Finland now
ranks high among the countries, regard being had to
its relative population. Some of the export statistics
have been mentioned; among items of import, grain,
meat and pork, sugar, coffee, and petroleum show
a considerable increase, testifying to the larger
consumption and more luxurious living of the people.
Besides these articles, metals, coal, and other materials
used in manufacturing and agricultural industry are
more largely imported. Within twenty years the
deposits in savings banks have quintupled, the capital
of the commercial banks has trebled, and the deposits
in the latter have been multiplied by ten. All these
statistics, as well as other facts about which we shall
speak later, point to the same conclusion.

Finland cannot be compared with America. It is
still a poor country and backward in many respects.
Also its progress is not quite on American lines. Still
it reminds us in many ways of the great country which
is progressing more rapidly than any other of modern
times. Scandinavian emigrants of the peasant class
very seldom return to their country with the intention
of remaining there; or if they do, they nearly always
change their mind and go back to the United States.
With the Finlanders it is different, perhaps partly on
account of the difference in their language, which
makes it less easy for them to amalgamate with the
Americans. In the case of Scandinavians it must
be remembered that half the language of America is
nearly the same as their own. We are told, however,
that the case is the same with the Swedes from
Finland; and the reason for the more frequent return
of the latter to their native country may very well be
that in Finland there are the same opportunities for
improvement, cheap land, etc., as in the United States.
Even the poverty in Finland reminds us of what has
been said about Western America: “it is not poverty
but incipient wealth.” At all events we find in
Finland an admirable capacity for improvement. The
question still remains whether this will be hampered
by unnecessary difficulties coming from political
sources.

<chapter name="II. The Agricultural Classes">
<h2><small>CHAPTER II</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>THE AGRICULTURAL CLASSES</small></small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> all northern countries the “bönder,” or
peasant-proprietors, form the most important class. They are
inferior in most respects to the tenant-farmers of
England and to the landowners of the United States;
but they are superior to the small peasants of Southern
and Eastern countries. This is partly due to the fact
that in the North, as well as in the mountainous
districts of Central Europe, it is impossible to make a
living by agriculture on a very small scale, whereas
with the grapes and fruit-trees of the sunny South it
requires little labour to make money out of a very
small piece of land. This superiority is, however, also
largely due to the social history and the peculiar
development of the people, which accounts, too, for the
fact that in North-Western Europe we have this
middle-class of peasant-proprietors. In Russia, on the
contrary, we find only the “moujik”; while in
Germany, east of the Elbe, as well as throughout the
Russian Baltic provinces, where the Germans have
conquered Slav lands, we find large estates, generally
occupying from a third to half of the land of the
district; and in some parts of the country (in Mecklenburg, 
on the island of Rügen, and in parts of Pomerania
and North-Eastern Holstein) occupying nearly the
whole. Without doubt this middle-class is a great
source of strength; it has, for instance, enabled
northern nations to colonise in a manner entirely
different from that of Portugal or Spain. It is a
misfortune when any class is too self-contained, too
immobile; and the recent progress of the peasantry is due
to its diffusion as a class. But its existence in modern
Finland is a great advantage compared to the social
state of most other countries. To some extent it is
developed from the old village community with its
communal cultivation of land; the “bönder” shared
in this common cultivation, while the large farms
of the gentry and the small plots of the cottiers were
outside the common lands, the former being too
important, the latter too insignificant to form part
of them. But this middle-class does not owe its
existence solely to this ancient method of holding and
cultivating land. A powerful peasant class exists in
those smaller districts of the North which were
divided into isolated farms without villages or common
cultivation and property; and, on the other hand, it
does not exist in countries where the old communal
cultivation of the land was the rule, but where, before
the systematic enclosure and distribution of mixed
farm lands, the possibilities of cultivation favoured the
division of land into very small plots. The condition
of the peasantry is mainly determined by the character
of their agricultural labour, which is again dependent
on natural conditions. In reality, the largest peasant
farmers came into existence precisely owing to this
absence of village communal proprietorship; either
because the old settlement took place on already
existing farms (as Meitzen supposes to have been the case in
Germany west of the Weser, and in the adjacent parts
of Belgium and France, where Teutons, according to
him, entered and settled down in old Celtic farms),
or the first colonisation dates from a time when the
system of common land was falling into disuse, and
the poverty of the land led to the occupation of
entirely isolated farms. This has occurred in large
districts of Scandinavia and Finland, at some distance
from the coast or on the hilly watersheds between the
rivers, where the bönder were obliged to settle down
each man by himself, a situation which has contributed
largely to their strong and independent character.

Certainly there is a great deal of poverty in Finland.
This is the case especially in remote districts far away
from civilisation, where the forests are as yet untouched
and valueless. It is also the case in the eastern parts,
including the south-east, where the peasants have been
unluckily bound to the large domains given away by
Russian rulers when these lands were taken from
Sweden at a period before modern reforms had begun
to take effect. The manner in which some of these
peasants live, in miserable houses, with a pig in the
same room as the family, is sometimes compared to
the style of living of the Russian peasants. But even
in this part of Finland the peasants cannot be
compared to the Russian “moujiks”; nowhere in Finland
is there anything like the class of poverty-stricken
moujiks which we find in large parts of the interior
of Russia. The Finns always live much better,
demand much more from life, and have not the habits
of the miserable Russian peasants, who spend most of
the winter asleep on their great ovens, so that they
may still further reduce their already small
consumption of food. Nor do we find in this eastern part of
Finland an unusual number of paupers in receipt of
relief, a fact which is partly due to the facilities for
earning money afforded by the neighbourhood of St.
Petersburg. A relatively large amount of pauperism
is found in the remote country districts, where the
peasant proprietors themselves in bad years live on
bread made from bark and chopped straw, and where
the few sheep they slaughter are rarely eaten by
themselves, or at most only supply a small quantity of
salted meat. In these remote districts, even in the
first part of the nineteenth century, many large parishes
had no communication with the outer world except by
riding-tracks.

Generally speaking, it is in the west and south that we
find large peasant farms such as are found in all
Scandinavian countries. The dwelling-houses, usually painted
red with white window-casings, give an impression of
prosperity. The house has a considerable number of
rooms, with fine tiled stoves and good furniture, the walls
being covered with books and paintings of popular
leaders, of the recent great deputation to St. Petersburg, 
or sometimes of members of the Imperial family
who have been regarded as friends of the Finnish
people. The peasant proprietor of such a house
would have four or five horses, twenty or thirty
cows, good farming implements, possibly of English
or American manufacture, and sometimes even a small
steam-engine. The houses are built round a quadrangle 
in the same style as in Denmark, or like the
old houses of the Franks. In the west, in Ostrobothnia, 
where the farmers are generally well-to-do,
the houses usually have two storeys. Farther in the
interior, in Tavastland for instance, the farmhouses are
often grouped together into villages, especially those
on the shores of rivers and lakes; the farm-lands,
however, lying scattered some distance away. The houses
are not built round a quadrangle, but spread over a
larger space, and often stand in long rows. Here, as
in other parts of the country, there is frequently a
separate house attached to each farm for the use of
the pastor or other visitors.

As a rule, the farmers are less wealthy in the
interior, but even there they are well off. In Savolaks,
a country of islands and peninsulas and innumerable
large lakes, the peasants generally choose for their
house a fine situation near the water, with a view
over the lake or river. Here they find some fishing,
and in the neighbourhood of these lakes their corn is
less likely to be damaged by frost. Occasionally too,
in these parts, the farmhouse is built on a hill, because
the frost is less severe than in low foggy places, and the
land, although covered with boulders and small stones,
is easier to cultivate than the richer lands in the
valleys, which are generally wet, and, even when they
are drained, have often a substratum of large flat
stones. Here, too, the houses are often unpainted,
as in the poorer parts of Sweden and Norway. The
acreage under cultivation is small, but the pastures on
the site of the burnt-down forests are relatively rich.
The peasants here have always been good
butter-makers, the butter having a fine flavour due to
the aromatic herbs in the pasture lands. They have
fish, too, and mutton, and in parts of Carelia there
is better bread than is to be found in the rest of
Finland — bread baked once or twice a week, and not
as elsewhere a few times a year only. Here in Carelia
many of the farms are “krononatur”; that is, the
farmers are hereditary tenants of the Crown with a
right of sale. We shall refer to this again later.

In the eastern part of the country we still find a
certain number of “savu-pirtti” or “smoke-cottages,”
a few of which are also found in the north and in
other parts of the country. Formerly they were quite
common, now they number less than 12,000. We
hear of the same kind of house in old Scandinavia,
in Ireland, and elsewhere. It has an open fireplace,
and the smoke is let out by openings in the roof, or in
the wall just below the roof. There are no windows,
and the smoke usually forms a dense cloud in the
upper part of the room, the air below being warm and
clear. But the wind drives the smoke downwards, and
eye diseases are frequent where this kind of house
exists. When the peasant himself lives in a
smoke-cottage, he has generally another building for the
reception of strangers.

The origin of the word “savu-pirtti” is not without
interest. The word “kota” or “cuda” (a hut), which
is seen in the English word “cottage,” is common in
the Finnish language; and round huts are still in use
among certain Finnish tribes in the east. The word
“pirtis,” which occurs in “savu (smoke) pirtti,” is
supposed to come from the Lithuanians and Letts, among
whom it means “bath-house.” Like the Finns to-day,
and unlike the Russians, these people made free use
of the bath. The pirtis was used among them as a
bath-house, as well as a drying-house for grain-sheaves;
and some of the Esthonians still use it for both
purposes. According to this origin of the word, this form
of building is supposed to have been learnt in very old
days from the Lithuanians and Letts, just as, later, the
Finns learned most of their domestic economy from the
Scandinavians.

The abundance of wood is a great feature in the
domestic economy of the Finnish peasant. The forest
frequently provides a considerable part of his income,
in some districts the largest part. As in other forest
countries, he uses wood for everything, often with
great extravagance. He burns an enormous quantity,
and spends much labour in carting and chopping it.
The houses are built of wood, chiefly of solid timber,
and not of boards, as in Sweden and Norway. Some
of the outhouses are built of granite, often of large
hewn stones; while the outhouses of the peasants are
often only built of round stones piled together. It is
curious that during a fire the most solid granite walls
crack under the influence of the water from the
fire-engines.

Every Finnish family has its <i>sauna</i>, or bath-house.
It is the first place built, and the family live in it
until the rest of the house is ready. In this bathhouse 
is an oven filled with stones, and steam is created
by throwing water on these stones. The bathers lie
on large berths under the roof, and improve the effect
of the bath by whipping themselves with birch-twigs. 
Every one takes a bath on Saturday night;
and during harvest-time, hay-making, and
forest-burning they take one every night. It is commonly
said that Englishmen and Hollanders are the only
clean nations. The people of Finland are cleaner
than the people of England or Holland.

It is difficult to estimate the average size and
average value of these peasant farms. Generally a
peasant has (including forest and pasture land) at
least 100, 250, or 400 acres. In the more
highly-cultivated districts we might say that the area of
land capable of cultivation on a Finnish peasant farm
of average size is the same as that of a farm in the
United States, or as that of the German and
Scandinavian farms before they were subdivided — namely,
120 acres. Even in the most fertile provinces, such
as Nyland, Åbo-Björneborg, and Vasa, the total area
is not less than 400 to 450 acres, because so
much uncultivated land is found everywhere. I11
the province of Viborg the average size is only 245
acres, not because this province is richer but
because the peasants have been impoverished by the
large domains given away by Russia in the last
century. In the northern forest country the farms are
much larger; in certain parishes they are regularly
of 3250 to 5000 acres; and in the Lappmark some
farms are said to cover an area of 600,000 acres. In
the not entirely satisfactory statistics published by the
government, the farms are divided into four classes,
according to their size. There are altogether about
118,000 farms, of which 32,000 contain less than 5
hectares (12½ acres) of cultivated land, 61,000 contain
from 5 to 25 hectares (62½ acres), 22,000 contain from
25 to 100 hectares (250 acres), and 2700 contain
more than 100 hectares. These four divisions represent
proportions of 28 per cent., 51 per cent., 19 per cent.,
and 2 per cent. of the total number of freehold farms.
Besides these, there are 72,000 small holdings,
forming part of other properties. It is scarcely possible to
calculate the average price of land, because the
proportion of pasture and forest land causes the value to
vary considerably. A comparatively large farm can
be bought for 15,000 to 20,000 marks (<i>£</i>600 to
<i>£</i>800), a smaller one for 4000 to 5000 marks
(<i>£</i>160 to <i>£</i>200) — prices which seem sometimes to
represent barely the value of the buildings and
fixtures. Unlike most agricultural countries, however,
land in Finland during the last few years has
increased in value by at least 25 per cent.

Village communities in Finland have been no less
common than in other Scandinavian and Teutonic
countries, including the eastern part of England, with
the exception of Kent. On ancient maps, before it
was decided, according to laws dating from the middle
of the eighteenth century, to enclose the common
lands, we may study the settled parts of the country
(Ostrobothnia and the south-west: and even in the
east, where the country was settled, as, for instance, on
Lake Ladoga and the River Vuoksi), and see
everywhere common fields with numerous small plots, each
the property of some small holder. The learned
Professor Meitzen of Berlin, who has gone more deeply
than any one into this matter, continuing the studies
of the Danish Professor Olufsen at the beginning of
the century, is inclined to attribute this partition to
the date of the settlement, when, in the period
between Cæsar and Tacitus, the people abandoned their
nomadic life for agriculture. The Danish author
Lauridsen considers that it was mediæval law and
custom which produced this method of holding
common lands. Certainly in Finland it was due to
Swedish custom and mediæval legislation. The
Finnish tribes living in Northern Russia seem to have
inhabited large isolated dwellings, and did not live in
villages, or, still less, hold lands in common. With
the division of the family the land, too, has been
subdivided, thus giving rise to the idea of private
property. The “Mir,” or Russian communal village, was
created by order of the government, who proclaimed
all land in this part of the Empire to be crown land;
and by a decree of 1829 this proclamation has finally
been enforced. It was probably the Swedes who
introduced ordinary European methods of agriculture into
Finland. To the advantage of agriculture irregularly
mixed plots were abandoned, and the law directed
that village lands should be divided into long, regular,
parallel plots by the system known as “sol-skifte,” or
sun distribution. There are decisions about enforcing
this system in the Finnish laws as early as the
fourteenth century, where it is called “right Swedish
distribution.” It seems to have been an advance on
the primitive agricultural method of an earlier period;
just as later on it was a great advance when this
system of partition was superseded by distribution into
single farms, with the buildings of certain farms placed
outside the village.

The word <i>torp</i> (the English “thorpe”) has different
meanings in different countries. In Germany <i>dorf</i>
means the common village. In Denmark the word
torp and its numerous derivatives signify always an
outlying hamlet, an offshoot from the <i>by</i>, which
means the original settlement. In the case of a
single farm the word is only used where a large
farm has absorbed the whole of such an outlying
hamlet. In Sweden and Finland <i>torp</i> and <i>torpare</i>
are used to describe a small holding of land and its
inhabitant; and in Finland it is further used about
such a holding when it is not owned by the actual
tenant, but forms part of a possession belonging to
another man. There are about 72,000 of these, and
many are of some considerable size, containing from
12 to 25 acres of cultivated land; so that the tenant,
by the help of additional pasture land, can often keep
one or two horses and four to seven cows, or even
more. Such holdings might elsewhere be called
farms; and the difference between the large 
“torp”-holders and the peasant tenants or land-bönder of
Finland (of whom in 1893 hardly 6000 were left,
and barely 1000 on the estates of the nobles) is
merely that the land-bönder rent the whole farm,
which is the unit for purposes of taxation.
Nevertheless the torp-holder often has a good house and
fair furniture, though his condition, like that of the
bönder, differs in different parts of the country.

In Finland, as in Sweden, rent for these torps is
usually paid in labour. This is chiefly the result of
custom, and might now often with advantage be 
discontinued. In other cases, however, the great distances,
and the primitive economic conditions of the country,
make it desirable for both parties to agree that the rent
shall be so paid. The tenant cannot sell his spare
labour to others, and the landlord cannot easily obtain
labour elsewhere. The torp-holder or cottier usually
binds himself also to work for his landlord, occasionally
also to act as a carrier during his spare hours,
receiving payment for any work beyond what is sufficient
to pay his rent. In the case of small torps held, for
instance, by artisans who have other kinds of work,
the tenants are sometimes only obliged to give their
labour for a few days in harvest-time or hay-making
time, when labour is of exceptional value to the large
farmer. Sometimes the torp-holder has built his own
house — a fact which is, of course, considered in the
rent. In the eastern part of the country, in Carelia,
and also in the north, where the landlord has less need
of labour, the cottier sometimes pays his rent in kind,
paying one-third of the net crop of grain, or even
one-half if the owner has provided the seed. For waste
land just reclaimed, nothing is paid for the first three
years. For the right to grow crops on the “svedje” or
burnt forests, a right which is to be used for a few years
only, the tenant pays from one-quarter to one-third of
the harvest. One reason for paying rent in kind is
the lack of a regular market for grain, and the variation
in the harvests, caused especially by the frosts.
Occasionally the cottier lives too far from his landlord to
work for him. Sometimes he has the right of
hay-making, paying one day’s labour per week for each
load of hay.

The Legislature has so far interfered (or proposed to
interfere) only with the following points in the position
of torp-holders and land-bönder: (1) Contracts must
be in writing and witnessed; otherwise they will be
regarded as binding for ten years. (2) A valuation
must be made when the tenant takes or gives up
possession. (3) All dues, especialty labour, must be
specified and fixed, though rent in kind may be paid
either in a fixed quantity or as a certain proportion of
the harvest. (4) Improvements must be paid for
according to valuation, making allowance for reasonable
profit accruing from them; improvements on a large
scale may not, however, be made without permission of
the owner. Hereditary tenancies continuing for more
than two generations are not encouraged by modern
legislation.

Besides the torp-holders there is a class not mentioned
in the official statistics. These are the smaller cottagers,
the “backstugusittare,” who, together with kindred classes,
number, according to a careful private calculation, about
100,000. Most of these cottagers have also a small
patch of land, usually pasturage for one or more cows.
In many countries the labourers would be happy if,
like these Finnish cottagers, they had cows which gave
sufficient milk for the family. Many of these cottagers
are very poor; others are better off. Some aim at
becoming torp-holders by reclaiming waste land. Many
workmen have not even a cottage, but live in rooms in
other people’s houses.

The situation of this large class, which has no home
of its own, is often a very unfortunate one. In former
times these “inhysingar” and their families were often
in a most curious and precarious position. The Pauper-Law 
required that some householder should be responsible 
for them, and that they should not move out of
their own parish unless they could get some one to give
security for them. This hindered their freedom of
movement, as did the old Poor-Law in England. The
peasant farmer with whom they lived could only employ
them for a small part of the year, and they passed the
long winter sleeping by the fire or elsewhere. Even
to-day, people of this class seldom have beds. In those
days even their clothes did not always belong to them.
In modern times they are better off, because there is
more work to do, but the winters are still a great
difficulty.

In addition to their tenants who pay rent in labour,
many of the bönder employ ordinary hired labourers,
chiefly to drive their teams of horses. Some of these
(the “drängar”) have their meals on the farm, others
(the “statkarlar”) are paid in kind and are also provided
with pasture for a cow. Even more elaborate arrangements 
are made with the “spanmåls-karlar” (“grain-workers”), 
who, besides being paid in grain, receive a
piece of land for their own use, and are, therefore,
granted certain days on which to work for themselves.
A farm-hand, in the wealthier districts, can now earn
from six to seven hundred marks a year, a temporary
labourer 2½ marks a day in summer, or 1.75 marks in
winter; a woman, 1.30 marks in summer and 1 in
winter; and a man with a cart and horse, 4.60 marks
in summer and 3.20 in winter.

On Åland and the numberless other islands situated
in the south-west and on the southern coast, as well
as on parts of the Bothnian coast, we find the same
three classes as on the mainland: the middle-class,
the cottagers with land sufficient for cows and sheep,
and finally a class without property and reduced to
work for others. These islands, like the Finnish
mainland, are extremely beautiful, clothed with more
luxurious vegetation than the mainland, covered with
different kinds of trees, and the soil sometimes
mixed with marl, though in large parts the islands
are pure granite. Most of the inhabitants are sailors
or fishermen. The introduction of steam-boats has,
of course, brought many changes, and caused a
number of men to seek work abroad. When the
men-folk are at sea the women-kind cultivate the land.
This is the case also on the coast of the mainland,
especially in Ostrobothnia, where there is also a large
sailor population and a great amount of emigration.

The large farms, the “herregårdar,” which are owned
by gentlemen farmers, are found in the same
proportion to other farms as is the case in Denmark and
Sweden. They are more numerous than in Western
Germany, but very few compared to Germany east
of the Elbe or to the greater part of Austria-Hungary.
They are nearly all found in the south of Finland,
“where every manor is a monument and every churchyard 
a tomb of heroes.” This is a part of the country
famous in history, the cradle of Finnish civilisation.
Here are found nearly all the old manor-houses, the
“säterier” or “ypperliga frälse;” which number 260.
Except for their entire exemption from the tax on
real estate, which is to-day more of a rent to the
Crown than a tax, no privilege now attaches to these
manorial properties. Other properties formerly in
the hands of the gentry, the “allmänna frälse,” are
partially exempt from taxation, because of their old
obligation of feudal military service, by which they
had to provide a certain number of mounted troops.
Of the total units of taxation in the country, some
19,000 in number, only one-tenth belong to this class,
which is more or less exempted from taxation, and
most of these are situated in the south. We mention
this because the “allmänna frälse” represents land
formerly belonging to the nobles and gentry. The
large farms (<i>i.e.</i> farms of 250 acres or more) which
are not exempt from taxation are found in still larger
numbers in the districts of Tavastehus, St. Michel,
and Vasa. In the same districts, especially in Vasa
and Tavastehus, are also found a large number of
ordinary peasant farms containing from 12 to 60
acres of cultivated land. In Uleåborg, the most
northerly district, there are hardly any considerable
farms, but a great number of small peasant farms.

In 1896 there were 900,000 acres in the hands
of noble families against 4,000,000 held by them in
1862, this change being chiefly due to a fact about
which we shall speak later, that the Russian estates
in the south had been bought by the Finnish
government. Of estates entailed in perpetuity there are
now only nine left. The very large farms continue
to increase in area. They are especially well adapted
for the use of machinery and the sinking of capital,
and respond to intelligent care more readily than the
others. The smaller “herregårdar,” on the contrary,
are decreasing in number. One hears on all sides
about the large number of upper-class families who
are selling their farms to the peasant farmers, the
latter being ready to buy because they live more
economically and spend less on expensive kinds of
labour. Many of these peasant farmers raise
themselves into the upper class; their sons go to the
University or obtain a superior education by some
other means. The old families emigrate into the towns
in order to educate their children, or because they have
taken up new industrial and commercial occupations.
Some great properties are now being turned into
joint-stock companies. For the most part it is the timber
business which is so dealt with, the companies having
more facilities for working and disposing of the timber.
They take better care of the forests, too, than the
peasant proprietors. In some cases the companies
cultivate farms on their own account, the Jokkis
Joint-stock Company, for instance, which owns some 70,000
acres, half of which is land under cultivation and only
a minor part of which is let. Companies of this
description have sufficient capital to take advantage
of all the newest improvements, but this one has been
especially enterprising, as it has built a 20-kilometre
railway, and established several thriving industries on
its property. It is by these industries and not by
farming that the company is making money.

It is not only in England that the system of letting
large farms prevails. This is the case in a minor
degree in other countries with a social system more
like that of Finland; in Denmark, for instance, where
many large farms are in the hands of tenant farmers
with thorough technical knowledge of their business.
In Finland this is seldom the case, less frequently even
than in Prussia. Perhaps technical agricultural
education is neglected. More probably it is the interest of
the owners to keep the estates in their own hands in
countries such as Finland, where, as a rule, there is
more than one kind of business, forestry as well as
agriculture, and many other forms of paying industry.
Besides this, there are many “boställen” or Crown
lands, large or medium-sized farms which are let on
a carefully-drawn lease for periods of twenty-five years.
Many of these properties have belonged to the Crown
from ancient times, and many of them were subject
to a rather arbitrary proceeding known in Finnish
history as “the reduction,” by which, in 1680, lands
granted by former kings to the nobles were taken
back by the Crown. In recent times most of these
farms, 800 in number, were made over to the officers
of the army; the whole army, officers as well as
soldiers, being quartered on and supported by farms
in different provinces. Nowadays, when the former
army system has been replaced by the ordinary
Continental form of conscription, these farms are let.
Their total area is 650,000 acres, of which 125,000
are under cultivation. Besides the above, about fifty
other farms belong to the State in the same manner,
some of these latter being old royal manors; others
formerly the houses of government officials; others
having been bought by the Finnish government
during their purchase of the old Russian domains; others
belonging to hospitals and similar institutions. The
total area of these is 55,000 acres, of which some
12,000 acres are under cultivation. Finally, the
rectors and vicars of the Lutheran Church hold
about 700 other farms, with a total area of 850,000
acres. This is about the same acreage as that held
by the nobles, but is of less value, because many of
these farms are situated in the north or in other
poor districts. The wives of the clergy take great
interest in the management of the farms, and, as a
rule, this glebe-land is even better cultivated than the
peasant farms.

In 1864, the exclusive right of the nobles to own
land entirely exempt from taxation was abolished, and
now anybody can own any kind of land. We shall
deal later with the liberty now granted to every one
to follow any industrial or commercial pursuit, and
with the abolition of all guilds and close corporations.
In every respect the old class privileges are abolished.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2><small>THE LAND LAWS OF FINLAND</small></h2>

<sc>There</sc> is one great difference between a self-governing
people and those who are oppressed by their rulers or
by a privileged class; that in the case of the former
revolution is unnecessary. Violent change may, for
some reason, be necessary in a country, and it may
be carried out by a popular movement or by an
autocratic decree, but it is always less happy in its
consequences than a change due to free natural evolution.
We see, for example, the immediate effects of the
changes produced by the French Revolution; by the
Hapsburg monarchy, and by the rulers of Prussia
and even more of Russia, which illustrate the
difficulty of revolutionising rural institutions; and the
advantage possessed by countries where such
measures are unnecessary. In Finland natural
development is the rule, the only exception to it being that
part of the country which was under Russian rule
during the last century and was therefore organised
according to Russian principles.

Throughout the greater part of Finland rural
legislation has chiefly concerned itself with enclosures, that
is, the abolition of the common property of parishes
and villages, and the distribution of the intermixed
acres of common village-fields among the several
proprietors. These measures, which were essential to
every kind of progress, have been of the greatest
benefit to the people. “Storskifte,” this re-distribution
into compact farms, was decided upon in 1750, a time
when philanthropists all over Europe were working for
the good of their kind. The work has, however, only
recently been finished, and as late as 1848 some
parishes in the east had enormous tracts of forests not
only undivided among separate proprietors, but held
in common by several villages and parishes. The
work was, of course, imperfectly done at first, so that
much had to be done over again and much to be
entirely changed. Now, however, the farms have been
more conveniently arranged, a number of farmhouses
have been moved out from the villages, and the whole
work of enclosure is being satisfactorily accomplished.

In old days the Kings of Sweden maintained a
claim not only to the so-called Upsala Öden, but to all
waste lands. Later on many of them (notably King
Eric of Pomerania in the days of the Scandinavian
Union, and other powerful rulers who were chiefly
concerned about the State treasury and their private
purse) enforced the right of any settler to take
unoccupied land, the villagers who had rights in the
woods not being permitted to hinder him. Gustavus
Vasa declared that “waste lands belong to God, the
Crown of Sweden, and the King.” Charles IX. required
the cottiers or torp-holders, the smaller settlers on
this waste land, to pay rent to the Crown, and not to
the bönder or peasant proprietors of the village.
To-day the Crown lands have been separated from
those of the peasants, the Crown retaining for the
most part the big forests of the north where there are
no villages, and also what is left over after the
enclosure and distribution of the commons among the
peasants. According to laws of the eighteenth century,
750 to 1500 acres (in some parts 2000 acres) are
considered to be the proper maximum for each peasant.
After the organisation of the forest administration in
1859 and 1863, the authorities were inclined to
prevent any settlement in the State forests, and to
dispossess the tenants who were already there; this being
the case not only on the forest Crown lands reserved
by the State for timber-growing. When we remember
that formerly there was complete liberty to use and
settle on these lands, we cannot wonder that
complaints were heard and had to be dealt with in the
newly-revived Diet during the sessions of 1863-1864,
1867, and 1872. No fewer than 10,000 persons were,
it was believed, living on these lands, most of the
families residing there without having complied with
the rules about the tax-assessment and so without
acquiring legal right. In 1867, and again in 1872—3,
measures were taken to secure the position of the men
who had really cultivated this land. On the whole,
the existing law, especially the provisions of the Forest
Law of 1886 and of the Colonisation Law of 1892, is
very favourable to the settlers, favouring them indeed
at the expense of the Crown. It is not unlike the
American Homestead Law, which gives grants of land
on the condition of cultivating a small part and paying
an insignificant fee. It has been decided that these
Crown lands which are fit for cultivation shall be
separated from the forest land, surveyed, mapped out,
assessed for taxation, and offered to people who wish
to settle. The settlers are to have an additional
advantage; that for the first fifteen years they are
entirely exempt from taxation, and have to pay only
half taxes for the next five, while they may perhaps
get this exemption extended to forty years. The
taxation is very moderate, being only from two to twelve
Finnish <i>penni</i> (<i>i.e.</i> from a farthing to a penny) per
hectare. In the far north, where the common land
has not yet been enclosed and allotted, permission to
settle may nevertheless be granted. Large tracts of
land which are not adapted for agricultural purposes
or for forestry may be treated as communal land and
granted to villages or other associations, or allotted
among the farms of the neighbourhood. Portions of
this land may even be sold. Marsh land when drained
can also be offered for settlement on the liberal terms
which we have described. This and other land can be
let provisionally until the final arrangement is made.

In fact, however, few persons have availed themselves 
of this new law, liberal as are its provisions.
Between 1868 and 1896 only 466 such farms were
established, some of these being already in
existence and now only obtaining an acknowledgment of
their legal status. The majority were formed in the
north. With the means at command it has been
totally impossible to finish the work of separating this
land from the forests, surveying it, mapping it out, and
so on. The Forest Administration prefers to make
the holdings small ones and to let them. This
arrangement, by which the land can be retained as
government property, can be made without separating
the large tracts of land which are to be retained as
forests from the land which in the future will be
given up to settlement. In 1869 there were 1300
of these small Crown holdings and 400 houses
with less land, of which, however, about 200 were
abandoned again, as frequently happens in the
American settlements. In 1897 the number of
small Crown holdings had increased to 2700,
although some of these had been changed into
freehold farms of the kind just described, or into small
holdings for the forest guards. These Crown torp-holders 
are comparatively well-off; for the first twenty
years they pay no rent; sometimes for the latter part of
their period they pay only half or one-third of the agreed
rent, which is itself less than the average rent paid to
private landlords. It varies from one-fourteenth of
the total grain and hay crops, which is the average in
the far north (as in Kemi, for example), to as much as
one-sixth in Viborg, one-fifth in St. Michel, and
one-fourth in Tavasthus; the pasture and timber from the
woods often more than paying the rent. A lease is
granted for twenty-five years with the option of
renewing it for another twenty-five, the widow and children
having the right to remain till the expiration of the
lease if the husband dies. Compensation is paid for
all improvements.

To fully understand the position of the settlers on
the Crown lands, some further explanation is required
of a certain Swedish-Finnish institution called 
“krono-hemman” or Crown farms. These farms, according to
official statistics, represent about 1500 (or 8 per cent.)
out of a total of 19,500 “mantals” or units of
taxation; another 16,000 out of this total representing
ordinary peasant farms. In 1896 these krono-hemman
were estimated to number 8000 out of a total of
117,000 farms. Originally the “krono-bönder” were
tenant farmers under the Crown, as the “land-bönder”
are tenants on private estates. In the course of time,
however, they have obtained so many rights, that they
are more like proprietors than tenants. Their rent
does not amount to more than the taxes paid by the
ordinary peasant proprietor. In early times they
gained an exemption from all payments for a certain
number of years, in order that they might take up the
cultivation of waste land and abandoned farms; they
received such an exemption, for instance, in 1723, after
the great war, and frequently again later, the last 
occasion being in the recent colonisation law, which made
provision for such exemptions. These tenants have
also the right of inheritance, which right is even
mentioned in the Act of Union and Security of 1789.
They can also sell their rights in the holding. The
Crown tenant can also change the condition of his
tenancy into full proprietorship or ordinary fee-simple
by the so-called “skatteköp”; that is to say, he has
been able, since the middle of the eighteenth century,
to convert his holding into an ordinary peasant
property or “skatte-hemman,” by an immediate payment
of three years’ (formerly six years) rent and taxes; and
since 1858 he has been allowed to extend this small
payment over a period of ten years. The tenant was
merely not allowed to exhaust the farm, but even the
proprietors of skatte-hemman, or ordinary peasant
farms, were not allowed to do this. According to
Finnish legislation, which has developed on the same
lines as the Swedish legislation, even after the
separation from Sweden, the possessor of a krono-hemman
is peculiarly circumscribed in the disposition of his
property at death; he is usually unable to give it
away to any one during his lifetime, or dispose of it
by will, and the widow has the right to retain
possession during her lifetime. The farm may be divided, if
each part can maintain a family. In arranging the
heritage, it is necessary for one person to be
responsible for the dues. If the eldest son, or other sole
inheritor on whom the others may fix, cannot pay the
share due to those others, they may decide by ballot
who is to take the farm. One inconvenient practice
already mentioned is a custom in the part of Finland
known as Old Finland, which was under Russian rule
in the last century, of several families continuing to
live together on the farm. Although the 
kronohemman is based on the principle that one man shall
inherit the farm, it has nevertheless been found
necessary here to make an exception when the parties desire
to continue a common occupancy. One man, the
“host,” has then to be in authority, and responsible for
all dues.

It is a curious modern example of methods freely
adopted in the times of our forefathers, that barely ten
or twenty years ago waste forest-land was occupied and
used in common by the peasants. This is a proceeding
which might help to explain the much-debated
formation of common fields in ancient and mediæval times.
Ten or twelve peasants in the eastern parishes not far
from the Russian frontier would arrange for the burning
of the forests and the cultivation of the land for some
years afterwards. This was done sometimes by a
family, sometimes by a party of peasants forming a
small informal company. The members of the
company shared the profits according to the “axes” or
number of persons whom they sent or brought. They
went 80 or 100 miles into the woods with sledges
loaded with everything necessary to pass the summer
there. They lived in huts, felled the trees, and came
again after the lapse of two summers to burn the trees
and undergrowth, and sow and reap crops (generally
rye) over an area of 20 to 40 acres. When they had
decided which area they intended to burn, it was
marked out on the trees, and these marks were
respected by all new comers for the three subsequent
years.

Though it has been generally unnecessary to
interfere with the rights of property, a peculiar situation
necessitating extraordinary measures arose in one part
of the country. In Old Finland, the south-eastern
corner of the country, ceded to Russia partly in 1721
and partly in 1743, Peter the Great and the Empress
Elizabeth made large donations of lands, as they
were accustomed to do in other parts of their empire.
Men with well-known Russian names, Apraxin,
Tchernisheff, Schuvaloff, Repnin, Vorontzoff, Trubetskoi and
others, obtained hundreds of farms here, sometimes
even a number of villages with thousands of inhabitants.
These were granted at first for indefinite periods or for
life, but later on were given as property to be inherited
and freely disposed of. Most of the peasants were
krono-bönder, or tenants with the right of inheritance
and sale, some of them even being peasant proprietors.
It was decreed that the nobles to whom these lands
were granted should receive two-thirds of the revenue
due to the Crown, the Crown retaining one-third; and
in 1728 it was decided that the peasants should pay
only the same amounts which they had paid when the
country belonged to Sweden.

In time, however, the peasants began to suffer from
acts of tyranny on the part of these new landlords,
who, as was their custom in Russia, seized farms, and
turned them into home-farms with manor-houses for
their own use. Their Russian estate agents demanded
that the peasants, with their horses, should work for
the landlord instead of paying their dues in grain.
The local government officials, many of whom had
come from the Swedish part of Finland, were usually
willing to recognise the rights of the peasants, but the
Russian nobles were not used to tolerating such
interference with what they regarded as their private
business, and refused to recognise the jurisdiction of these
government officials and their courts. Worst of all
was the treatment meted out to the peasants at the
imperial small-arms factory in Systerbäck, which
demanded so much work, that the four parishes from which
it drew its labour had to be replaced after a time by
another four. The local agent of the Alexander Nevski
Convent in St. Petersburg even refused to give the
peasants receipts for work and other dues paid to him,
and this proceeding was quite a common one. Accustomed 
as such overseers were in Russia to demand
work at their pleasure, they could not understand why
they should not claim the same rights in Finland, and
increase rents, and make what demands they pleased
from the peasants. In a famous lawsuit between
Baron Freedericksz of Taubila and his peasants, in the
reign of the Empress Catherine, a decision was given
by the Imperial Senate by which the landlord might
increase the rent of his peasants notwithstanding the
decision of 1728. When rent could be arbitrarily
increased, the peasants themselves no longer profited
by their own improvements. The Empress Catherine,
in whose reign, notwithstanding her liberal professions,
serfdom developed into such complete slavery that the
serfs could be sold off the estates, gave donations in
Old Finland of “souls with farms and habitations as
eternal and hereditary possession.” When the Russian
system of military conscription was introduced, and
young men were carried off to Poland and Turkey,
while those who stayed at home had to build barracks
and provide everything which was used in them, many
of the young men fled the country, and the peasants
tried forcible resistance, no fewer than twenty-eight
peasant riots taking place in a few years. Furthermore, 
even in the time of Alexander I., demands came
from the Russian nobles in Finland, especially from a
certain Major-General Kopyeff, that the government
should introduce into Finland a complete system of
Russian serfdom, and permit the nobles to locate the
peasants in big villages, where it would be easier to
control them. In a lawsuit between Count Orloff and
his peasants, it was decided by the Imperial Senate
that rent could be fixed by the landlord at his will,
and that peasants who tried to leave their estates
should be regarded as offenders against the Emperor
and as criminals. The landlords would not even
permit women to marry outside their estates without
permission.

Alexander I., who had by this time conquered the
whole of Finland, now decided that Old Finland, the
Province of Viborg as it was then called, should be
re-united to the rest of Finland. One of his reasons
was a desire to improve the position of the peasants;
their present position, he said, was well-fitted to make
the inhabitants of the rest of Finland afraid of his
rule. In this, as in several other matters, he acted on
the advice of the Finnish Count G. M. Armfelt, and
against the views of his Russian councillors. The
officials, many of whom were Germans, were reduced
in number from 217 to 89, and some incapable
persons were replaced by better men from Finland. The
Russian landlords would not, however, give up their
demands; they were so persistent, that the Secretary
of State for Finland in St. Petersburg, Count
Rehbinder, recommended that the Province of Viborg
should be again separated from Finland.

The nobles did not gain their point about the
introduction of serfdom, but they obtained an official
declaration that they were absolute proprietors of the
peasant farms. Alexander I., who had grown less
liberal than formerly, would not separate the province
from Finland, but Count Zakreffski, the
Governor-General of Finland, obtained the nomination of a
Finnish Committee under his presidency, which was
to decide the exact meaning of the letters of donation,
ignoring the previous rights of the peasants. He
obtained from this committee a declaration that the
landlords had the full rights of property, with the
exemption from taxes (the so-called frälse) which they
claimed; and with regard to their manors (which are
known as säterier) some further privileges in the matter
of taxation were granted. Those peasants who could
furnish valid proofs that their farms were proprietary
peasant farms, preserved their rights. Three senators,
who were members of the committee, further
recommended that the present tenants should be allowed
to keep their original rights for their lifetime.
Nicholas I., who had now ascended the throne, decided,
however, that the estates were to be the absolute
property of the landlord, even when originally they
had only been granted for a term of years; but
that, on the other hand, the peasants should retain
their old rights for ten years, that is till 1837. The
peasants continued a restive opposition, refusing to
sign contracts, and working badly when called upon
to work for their masters. Their labour, as a means
of paying dues, had lost two-thirds or three-quarters
of its ordinary value. Hundreds of farms were
deserted, so that the tyranny of the nobles did not
even benefit themselves. The movement was a
curiously exact repetition of what we have seen before
in other countries, where the peasants, by a change
in social and economic conditions, have lost their
rights in the soil, and sometimes lost their liberty
with it.

In the more liberal days of Alexander II., when
the Finnish Estates were once more convened in Diet,
this matter was, of course, one of the prominent
questions of the hour. The Emperor would not adopt the
course recommended by the Finance Committee as
well as by the whole Diet, and examine the legality
of the decree of 1826, which had given the full rights
of ownership in their estates to the Russian nobles.
It was thought better to make an attempt to purchase
these rights, which were not really of any great money
value, and then re-sell the farms to the peasants.
These latter would, of course, be obliged to pay full
value; to act otherwise would have been unjust to
the taxpayers; and it was calculated that the
purchase money distributed over the whole population
would mean an increase in taxation amounting on an
average to sixty marks for each family in the country.
The nobles, it was thought, would be satisfied if they
received sixteen and a half years’ purchase of their
rents. In 1867 the Diet gave permission to borrow
12,000,000 marks for this purpose, and the amount
has since reached 17,500,000 marks. Some of the
nobles sold at moderate prices; — Countess Varvara
Mussin-Puschkin, for instance, and her husband
Captain Kotchubei, and the Russian Department of
Mines, which demanded only 1,250,000 marks for
four northern villages with 12,000 inhabitants and
immense forests, which were kept as State
property. For certain other estates it was found
necessary to pay more than the estimated sum; as, for
instance, the estate of Prince Galitzin with its 5000
inhabitants, for which the owner asked 1,500,000
marks, the estate of Baron Freedericksz with its
population of 8000, which was bought for 2,500,000
marks, and that of Prince Oukhtomski, which also
contained a population of 8000, and for which
2,300,000 marks were paid. The estate of Kyyrölä
has recently come into notice, because some of the
peasants there sent, and induced the Emperor to
receive, a counter-address to the addresses of the
Finnish people after the <i>coup d'état</i> of 1899, when the
Emperor issued his famous Manifesto of February
15th. This estate consists of three villages which,
early in the last century, were settled with Greek
Catholic serfs, who had been drawn from the interior
of Russia to occupy the numerous deserted farms of
this district. The average price paid for all these
estates was not, however, very high, varying between
two and twenty marks per acre.

The farms have now been transferred to the peasants
on such conditions that in hardly any case are they
paying more than their old rent. They were supposed
to pay 5 per cent. on the purchase money, but when
the government was able to convert its loan, the
interest was put down to 4½ per cent. To this was
added 1 per cent. for amortisation, so that they can
become free proprietors in from 36 to 39 years. In
some cases they received even better terms, for the
value of the State forests was deducted from the price,
while on some estates the landlord’s manor was
retained by the government, and valued at a higher
figure. To some parishes large forests were allotted
as common property, the wood of which is sold
under government supervision at a considerable profit.
As a rule, until the farm has been fully paid for, the
peasants would not be allowed to sell wood. Some of
the forests are, however, said to have been very badly
managed, and it is suggested that too small a portion
of them has been reserved for government forests.
Some persons are inclined to think also that the
peasants have obtained too soon the right to dispose
of their farms. Too often they have found their way
to the money-lenders in spite of all legal precautions,
and under the form of a loan, have sold their wood,
and sometimes their farms as well. It is not easy to
change the habits of a race which has grown up under
harsh treatment. Progress, however, has been rapid.
There are no more deserted farms. On the estate of
Kronoborg, the home farm has been turned into an
agricultural school, greatly to the benefit of the
agricultural folk of the neighbourhood. Much benefit has
been derived on the same estate from the settlement
of Swedish peasants from Ostrobothnia, who came here
after the famine in 1867—8. Many of the farms have
only been transferred quite recently, because the
process of enclosure had to be finished before it was
possible to determine what each tenant had to pay.
The whole reform is a remarkable example of a
radical change, in which all private rights have been
most carefully respected. We, for our part, believe
that the English government would have done well
to treat Irish land in the same manner, instead of
depriving the landlords of part of their property, while
at the same time they left the tenants discontented
at not obtaining a clearly defined position. There is
nothing better for the small cultivator of the soil than
owning his land, and it is not impossible that it may
one day be found expedient in Ireland to imitate on a
larger scale the example of this northern country, and
purchase big estates to re-sell to the tenants.

It was, of course, highly desirable that as many as
possible of those persons who have no home of their
own should obtain land. Finland is inferior to the
most civilised countries of Europe, both in the number
of its landed proprietors and in the number of persons
entirely without homes, but it is far superior in both
respects to the less civilised nations of Southern and
Eastern Europe. There are better openings for
workmen nowadays, and a larger part of the population
can now live without homes of their own, and without
agreements for continuous work in one place. In 1895
the “unattached” population of Finland, as these families
are called who have no fixed home, was more than a
third of the total, having nearly doubled since 1877.
They are especially numerous in the north and east,
forming in some parishes as much as seven-tenths of
the population. This, of course, creates a certain
danger. It takes time to accommodate the habits
of a population to new places and new circumstances.
A large number of workmen do not at all desire any
settled home, because they have to move about
according to the locality of their work. This is the
case not only with such workmen as navvies, but with
part of the men who are engaged in Finland’s great
business, the lumber trade. Here, as in the United
States and other countries where this trade is
conducted on a large scale, there must necessarily be a
number of workmen who at certain times of the year
live out in the woods in temporary huts. Besides, in
order to settle down successfully on the land, a certain
amount of capacity and also of money is necessary,
even if the settlers become torp-holders and not
proprietors. It was regarded as an advance when the
torp system was introduced from Western Finland into
certain eastern parts, where many of the peasant
proprietors are not as advanced as those who rent land
in the western districts and pay their rent in labour.
These, also, in order to make the best use of their
holdings, must possess a certain capacity and capital.

It is always desirable to remove obstacles in the
way of dividing up the land. Such obstacles in the
past have been mainly fiscal; the subdivision of the
peasant farms, for instance, would have jeopardised
the ability of the peasants to pay taxes. Since 1864
several laws have been passed to facilitate this 
sub-division. According to the land law of 1895, however,
it is still illegal to subdivide a farm into smaller areas
than twelve acres; in any case a holding of this size
must be responsible for the whole tax. This prejudice
against very small holdings, however mistaken, is not
confined to Finland. There is no object in trying to
retain any particular class of peasant, either when it is
proposed to subdivide land or when farms are being
amalgamated by large proprietors. It has been
remarked that the facilities for owning small allotments
have been made use of more by inhabitants of towns,
who have bought land, than by agricultural labourers.
It is, of course, an excellent practice that town-folk
should buy land in the country. It has become very
noticeable in the Eastern States of North America,
where thousands of farms have been deserted owing to
the fall in the price of grain and the competition of the
richer farm lands of the West, and large numbers of
these abandoned farms have been acquired by persons
in the neighbouring cities, to whom it is not only a
pleasure and recreation during the summer to farm
their land, but who can also cultivate it with better
result than the poor and uneducated men who formerly
owned it. Any movement in this direction is good.

In 1887, it was resolved to lend money without
interest in order to aid the formation of torps or
small plots of land for labourers in the eastern district
of Kuopio; and in 1892, another fund was opened to
help the subdivision of estates in other parts of the
country, especially the district of Vasa in the barren
interior of Ostrobothnia. It is a characteristic fact,
however, that many of the new proprietors, who had
obtained their holdings in this fashion, hastened to
re-sell them to other people. It is highly important
that the credit system should be enlarged so that
small owners of land may obtain loans easily; the
present institutions for the purpose should be
developed, or new associations formed. The
Hypotheksförening (the Credit Foncier of Finland) does
not lend money on any property of less than 6000
marks in value. Other funds, formed in 1892 and
1896, were consolidated in 1899 into one fund of
550,000 marks, to be used for the purchase of small
building lots or plots of land for homeless persons,
or for the clearance of new lands, woods, moors, or
marshes. The money is lent to parishes, agricultural
societies, or other such institutions, for forty years
at 2 per cent, interest. They may either buy land,
or re-lend the money for this purpose to private
persons, keeping only 1 per cent. profit for
themselves.

A curious episode may be narrated in connection
with this matter. At the beginning of 1899, at the
time of the <i>coup d'état</i>, there appeared suddenly in
Finland a number of the pedlars who come there
sometimes from the Russian province of Archangel,
and are often men of Finnish race speaking the
Finnish language. These pedlars went round the
country promising that all landless persons should
receive land from the Russian government at the
expense of the present proprietors. Such emissaries
are often employed by the so-called Society of Charity
in Moscow, which works really in the interests of
Panslavism, and often in close connection with the
Russian government. Political agitations have been
started by them in several countries, in Bulgaria,
for instance. The lower classes in Finland, who are
as patriotic as the upper, did not receive these
emissaries at all kindly, and demanded that they
should be prosecuted; it being illegal for foreign
pedlars to go about in Finland. Some parishes used
the funds out of which rewards are paid for killing
wild beasts for the purpose of prosecuting and
punishing the pedlars. A decree has now, however, been
published under an order from St. Petersburg —
illegally, because no such matters can be decided
except by order of the Diet — permitting these pedlars
to sell their wares in Finland. The Finnish people,
who were perfectly willing before to do business with
these Archangel traders, have accordingly decided to
boycott them, and nobody will now have any dealings
with them. There is a fear that if the hawkers are
successful, they will settle in the country, bring other
settlers of the Greek Orthodox Church, and so
furnish a pretext to the government of St. Petersburg
for establishing Greek Orthodox communities and
churches.

Shortly after the incursion of these traders from
Archangel, the Emperor decided that two million
marks of the surplus on the Finnish budget should be
used to assist men without means to obtain land; and
a committee has been formed to arrange for the most
advantageous employment of this fund. It will not,
of course, produce any very important results compared
with those brought about by natural development. In
a country like Finland there is seldom any difficulty
in getting land; we have to look for the necessary
capacity for using it.

The usual measures have been taken in Finland to
enable workmen to provide their own homes in towns.
We may mention as one example a system which
we have studied in the city of Åbo, by which cheap
houses can be bought by the payment of small
instalments hardly larger than the usual rent. A minor
detail of this arrangement is that the purchasers of the
houses have rooms to let to the numerous workmen
who are satisfied with lodgings; and the purchasers
can thus facilitate their own payments. This practice
of poor people living in large numbers with one another
is a peculiarity of the life of the common people in
Finland, an evidence, indeed, of their good nature, but
not without its drawbacks. Many other examples might
be quoted of arrangements made for providing working
men with homes, arrangements undertaken either by
the men themselves or by their masters, as is the case
in other countries, and is natural in the case of a
country so advanced as Finland. The government is
authorised to lend money for this purpose for long
periods either to the municipalities of the cities or to
companies, the interest being 3½ per cent.

<chapter name="IV. Methods and Conditions of Agriculture">
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2><small>METHODS AND CONDITIONS OF AGRICULTURE</small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> greater part of Finland is not adapted for
agriculture. Geologically the country belongs to the
Scandinavian peninsula, and not to the great plain of
Eastern and Northern Europe. It consists mainly of
granite, gneiss, and glacial formations, the greater part
of which is poor soil for agricultural purposes. Lakes
and rivers are numerous, 11 per cent. of the surface
being water, or as much as 19 per cent. in Central
Finland, in Savolaks and Carelia. The lakes are large
hollows formed by the pressure of ice, as is the case in
Scotland, and are even more numerous than those in
Scotland, because the glaciation in Finland seems to
have taken place late, and the consequent formations
to be therefore in a relatively unfinished state. Land
and water are not yet fully separated. In addition to
the lakes, swamps and enormous bogs cover one-fifth
of the country, or nearly half in some parts of the
east and north. The surface consists of glacial
formations, partly changed by the action of the sea
after glaciation; that is of gravel formed of stones,
brash, pebbles, and sand, with a substratum of granite
rocks, and often littered with piles of loose boulders.
On the other hand there are also large plains, chiefly
formed in the post-glacial period when a part of the
country was covered by the sea, these plains being
clay and comparatively fertile. They are found chiefly
in Ostrobothnia and in the south, in Finland proper
and Nyland and Carelia, where also there is a
comparatively denser population, and whence comes
most of the grain. In comparison with Sweden,
Finland has more flat country, though its plains are
hardly so fertile as those of Upland, Westergötland,
and Scania. As a consequence of the prevailing
geological formation, the soil contains a good deal of
potash or kali. On the other hand there is not much
chalk or limestone. There is some chalk or marble
in the south-east, and shells useful for agricultural
purposes are found in Nyland, in Central Ostrobothnia
in the fertile regions of Vasa and Kyro, at the old
convent of Nådendal near Åbo, and on the island of
Åland, where also there is some good marl. The
whole of the land used for agricultural purposes does
not amount to much more than a tenth part of the
country, of which hardly 4 per cent. is really under
cultivation, and 5 per cent. is grass land. The land
under cultivation and capable of cultivation is,
however, increasing rapidly. Finland is north of the line
where the surface of the earth rises gradually above
the sea-level, and it is now continuing to rise at a rate
varying from .6 metre per century in the Gulf of
Finland to 1.5 metres in the north of Ostrobothnia.
Still more important is the draining of the lakes and
marshes, due partly to natural causes and partly to
very profitable labour. Even in Nyland, where
cultivation began at an early period, the amount of land
under cultivation has increased by more than one-third
since the beginning of last century. Large marshes
have been and are still being drained in the northern
part, especially in the province of Uleåborg. The
government assists with money, which is lent through
the medium of the parish authorities.

We have already spoken of the harsh climate. The
August frosts, as well as those of the spring, at which
time there is often a long drought, are a serious
disadvantage. In the north the winter lasts eight months,
in the south five months; and Southern Finland has
an average temperature of 9° Fahr. above freezing point
for the whole year against 5.4° below freezing point on
the river Jenissei, and 7.2° in Kamtschatka in the same
latitude. Grain ripens well in the far north of Finland,
and barley in the farthest north of all. We find barley
as far north as the pine; the six-row barley farthest
north; the common four-row kind, which we generally
call six-row, farther south; and the more valuable
two-row kinds (such as the English Prentice barley) farthest
south of all. As a rule barley predominates among
the grains grown north of 63.5°; it was the first grain
cultivated, the Finns having been in possession of it
before they came into the country. For a long time
nearly all bread was made of it, and it is still the staple
article of food in parts of the east as well as in the
wilds of the north. In the north-east a special kind
of barley-bread called “rieska” is baked in moulds
made of birch bark. The Swedish name for barley,
“bjugg” (Danish “byg”), is the same as is used in
Northern and Eastern Danish England. Rye, which
was introduced by the Swedes in very early times,
superseded barley to some extent in the eighteenth
century, and still later it was largely replaced by oats.
In the fourteenth century rye was cultivated only in
parts of Southern Finland. In the eighteenth century
it became, however, the most important material for
bread, and is now cultivated as far as the 64th and
65th degrees of latitude. In the years subsequent to
1870 the cultivation of rye increased enormously,
but later still, after 1887, it gave place to oats. Wheat
has only recently, and to some extent, been introduced
in the south, but its introduction has apparently been
a success. Oats grow as far north as the Arctic circle,
and have increased in value with the increase of dairy
business. They are especially well adapted for
newly-tilled land; and more room has been given to them in
the recent and more scientifically arranged rotation of
crops, in which, after the green crops, a place is found
for other grains than those needed for bread. Finally,
there is now less difference in price between the grains,
which is to the advantage of oats. In Eastern Finland
oats are also used for bread; but mainly they are used
for cattle-food, for which there is now a greater demand.
They are also exported. “Hafre,” the Swedish word
for oats, is almost the same as the “haver” of Northern
England. In the period 1866-70 rye represented 48
per cent. of the total harvest, barley 28 per cent., and
oats only 24, but in 1891-95 oats had advanced to 47
per cent., rye decreased to 36 and barley to 16 per
cent. of the total. In the province of Uleåborg, in the
northern part of the country, barley still represents
more than 60 per cent. and oats not 10 per cent. of
the crops.

A peculiar process is the Finnish method of drying
the grain in special houses, “riar,” as they are called.
In the late and cold harvest season the sheaves are
dried first on stakes and then, according to the custom
of all Finnish peasants, in the riar before thrashing.
For this purpose the peasants make free use of their
abundant fire-wood, burning a fire for three or four
days in a peculiar oven without a chimney, which is
used also for various other purposes. This method
of drying the grain by heat and smoke kills the
insects which destroy the germs of the grain, and
this is one of the reasons why Finnish rye from Vasa
or from Nyland is so highly valued for seed purposes.
Formerly, before the present duties checked this class
of import, the Swedes preferred to use Finnish rye as
seed; they could manage with a smaller quantity than
if they used their own rye. Very possibly other
countries would find it profitable to adopt this former
practice of the Swedes. The great farms often dry
their sheaves of rye, especially for seed; while with
other kinds of grain they do not take this trouble, but
only dry it after thrashing, as is done in other countries.
Buckwheat, used chiefly as human food, is grown on
some of the burnt-over lands in Eastern Finland.
Hemp, as well as flax, has been grown in the country
from very old times; the Kalevala, the great Finnish
mythical epic, dating from the later days of Paganism,
speaks of both, as well as of the common kinds of
grain; but hemp is not much cultivated now, and only
in Eastern and Northern Finland. Flax, which is well
adapted for newly-cultivated grass land, is more largely
used, and is in considerable demand in the country
round Tammerfors, where linen is manufactured. It
is more carefully tended here than in Russia, and is
therefore whiter.

In addition to the ordinary turnip, which has
recently been introduced into Finland, a particular
variety, yellow in colour with red or green tops, was
grown formerly to a considerable extent in the ashes of
the burnt forests. This variety can be grown as far
north as the lake of Enare (69½ degrees), and is still
used there, as well as in the east, for human food.
Generally, however, it has been abandoned for the
potato. In the south, mangels are grown successfully;
and in a district near Åbo, where a factory for
producing raw sugar from mangels was established, it was
suggested that the mangels contained as much sugar
here as they do farther south. The factory, however,
failed. The growth of turnips and mangels, which are
well suited to the rich newly-drained peat-bogs and
marshes, will, of course, be much increased by the
extension of dairy business.

Among cultivated grasses the Timothy grass (<i>Phleum
pratense</i>) is the most valuable. Experiments have been
made with other grasses adapted to a northern climate,
and it is found that the Alsike clover (<i>Trifolium
hybridum</i>) succeeds well. The red clover suffers from the
frost, especially in the far north. Other grasses,
particularly the fox-tail meadow grass (<i>Alopecurus
pratensis</i>), the ordinary orchard or coxfoot grass (<i>Dactylis
glomcrata</i>), the meadow or tall fescue (<i>Festuca elatior</i>),
one of the brome-grasses (<i>Bromus arvensis</i>), and still
others are now cultivated. On uncultivated land,
especially if it has been burnt over, several valuable
grasses, largely belonging to the same families, are
found, even the celebrated blue grass of America (<i>Poa
pratensis</i>). In wet meadows there are, of course, plenty
of the common sedges and rushes, which are not
without value. On the whole, the natural pasture land is
of very varying value, from the poorest pasture land
which is found in many of the woods, to the fine
meadows which reach their largest area near the big
rivers of Ostrobothnia, as well as by the Vuoksi and
the Kymmene and other minor rivers in the south.
In the province of Uleåborg in the north and in
Vasa, it is still the custom to send cattle to distant
pastures for the summer and keep them under
supervision there.

The result of grain cultivation in Finland is not
very great. Nevertheless, as is generally the case in
Europe, where a regular rotation of fallow and green
crops is the custom, it is superior to results gained in
the United States, where also the inclement climate in
most of the States exposes the grain to several dangers
during the most important period of its growth. On
an average rye and wheat return 7 for one (up to
1866 it was only 6 for rye); barley about 5 for one,
and oats 5½ for one (against 4 in 1866). The value
of the whole harvest in 1895 was estimated at
45½ million marks of rye, 17¼ million marks of barley,
36 millions of oats, 1½ millions of peas and beans, 1 of
mixed grain, 12¾ of potatoes, and only half a million
marks of turnips. The total harvest amounted to
114½ million marks. The harvest of 1896 was
estimated at 136 million marks; and these amounts
will be considerably increased with the development
of the dairy business. The production of grain has
increased largely during the last generation; it doubled
in amount between 1861 and 1895, and its proportion
to the population has increased from less than 4½
hectolitres per head in 1866 to nearly 5½ hectolitres
per head in 1896. Moreover, the consumption has
increased still more rapidly, and Finland cannot now
produce sufficient grain for its own use. The fact that
importation has increased even per head of the
population during the last few years may be regarded as
a proof that the country is growing in wealth and
prosperity.

The old Finnish method of agriculture was to burn
down the woods and sow seeds in the ashes round the
roots and stumps. This is profitable enough for the
persons who do it when neither the timber nor land
is of much value. Indeed, during the last generation
peasants have even grown rich by this method, which
is called the “svedje-bruk,” its more successful
practitioners having been known as “svedje-kings.” But
in modern times, when timber and land are both
valuable, this method means the destruction of capital.
The government tried some hundreds of years ago to
stop this method of cultivation; and it has now been
decided that the burning of the forests may only be
repeated at intervals of thirty years where the forest is
of hard wood, at intervals of forty years where it is
soft wood, and not at all on stony soil or rock thinly
covered with humus, or in pine-forests with heath or
sandy soil; while only two crops may be taken after
the burning. Some of these restrictions must be
regarded as a mistake. In Western Finland this
forest burning is now very little practised, though it is
still common in parts of the East. Over the whole of
Finland only a small percentage of the grain harvest
comes from this method of cultivation, though more
than half the harvest is so produced in Carelia and
Savolaks (parts of the present province of St. Michel
and Southern Kuopio) and some other parts of the
country. The first crop after the burning sometimes
gives a return of 50 to 1, and when it is no longer
possible to get good harvests of grain the grazing is
fine for some years afterwards. To burn the mosses
and undergrowth when the timber has been removed
is often desirable. As a rule it is better to use burnt
forest land for some years for grain production, and
afterwards for grazing purposes, and plant new woods
on old worn-out grass land and heath. These burnt-over 
woods are used for agricultural purposes in France
(where the process is called “sartage” or “écobuage”), 
in the Ardennes, in the Alps, and in Germany,
notable examples being found in Odenwald. A far
more pernicious practice is the burning of old grass
land, the fire being covered in with turf and allowed
to burn downwards. This has been done on low
ground bare of trees, and the land then made to yield
crops of oats till it is completely barren.

The old rotation of crops in Finland, as in most of
Northern and Central Europe, is to plant two out of
three fields with grain. In Finland the two-field
system also has been much used, because it was
thought advantageous and cheap to cultivate rye in
alternate years, allowing the fields to lie fallow in
the other years. This is still extensively done in
Upland, the part of Sweden opposite Southern Finland,
as the best means of producing wheat in loam or clay
soil. It may pay so long as land is of little value and
when sufficient pasture land is to be found elsewhere.
To-day, when it is desirable to cultivate oats and
grasses on the plough land, a better system of rotation
is being introduced and is now common over large
districts, especially on the big farms; while, on the
other hand, the peasants retain the old rotation. In
the north the cultivation of artificial grasses is
neglected.

To carry out this scientific system of rotation it
is necessary to produce more manure; and for this
purpose farmers have begun to import several kinds of
artificial manure, kainite, crushed bone and phosphates,
especially the Thomas-phosphate from ironworks, to
the value of about 500,000 marks a year. An import
duty has been put on salts from Stassfurt and on
nitrates. Crushed bone is produced in Finland.

In old days farming implements were used in
Finland which were unknown in other parts of Europe,
indicative of a backward stage of development. Some
were especially connected with the burning of the
forests. Among these is the forked plough, a very old
implement consisting of two long forks which move
the earth without turning it over. It is an even more
elementary implement than the angle-plough of the
Slavs, which in ancient writings was described as
peculiar to them. The Romans and Teutons used the
“aratrum” or turning-plough, supposed to have been
introduced into Finland by the Swedes. Another very
primitive implement is the branch-harrow, formed by
a bundle of branches or fir-tops, the stumps of the
branches being left on and used as harrow teeth. The
fork-plough and branch-harrow are still used by the
peasants of the east. Side by side with these ancient
implements in many parts of the country we now find
the newest models. Every sort of machine is now
in use, up to steam ploughs and an electric
thrashing-machine. Many implements are imported from
England, Sweden, and the United States, but many
more are now manufactured in the country. In
1885, when the Customs tariff was revised owing to
some antagonism between Russia and Germany, a
small duty was put on farming implements and
machinery; the duty was trifling, but it was a
hindrance to the importation of certain kinds of heavy
machinery. The variable amount of such imports,
which at one time showed an actual decrease, is due
chiefly to the establishment of machine manufactories
in Finland. Recently machinery has once more been
imported from other countries in comparatively large
quantities.

No animal is more beloved by the Finnish peasant
than his horse. The horse deserves it, being strong,
speedy, and patient. When the question arose of
improving the stock by foreign blood, the stallions
from the Norwegian Gudbrandsdal were preferred;
but the well-built though not very large Finnish
horses, usually roan, bay, or brown, compare most
favourably with the best Norwegian horses. They
number about 300,000, and though the number is not
increasing, as could hardly be expected in these days
of mechanical forces, it is not decreasing. The great
progress of agriculture naturally demands more horses.
Formerly a considerable number were exported to
Sweden; but Sweden has now imposed a duty of 100
kroner per horse on such imports, and more horses are
now sent to Russia. It is remarkable that a considerable 
number are found near the river Torneå, and it
seems that thousands of horses pass this frontier by
themselves — which is one way of evading the bad
effects of import duty. The Finnish horses sent over
to Sweden to take part in trotting-matches invariably
won, until the Swedes deliberately raised the height
of the competing horses, so excluding the Finnish
competitors.

Finland contains about 1,100,000 sheep, and the
number does not appear to increase much. On the
large farms, indeed, the number has decreased
considerably; as is the case in several other northern
countries, where it is now found more profitable to
increase the number of cows. The number of sheep
owned by the poorer class of peasant is, however,
increasing as they grow more prosperous; so that in
the west, where the peasants are better off than in the
east, the number is larger. The breed is a very poor
one, owing to the barren pastures and to lack of
attention during the winter; but it is being improved
by the importation of southdowns and other English
varieties suited to the country.

In the farthest north, on the tundras of the Lapps,
the reindeer is invaluable, and no other animal could
take its place. It not only provides milk, meat, and
skin for clothes and other purposes, but it does the
work of the horse, three reindeer being able to draw
as much as one horse. For some years the number of
them decreased steadily, partly because the wandering
of the Lapps over the Norwegian frontier was no
longer allowed. Between 1880 and 1897, however,
the number increased from 53,000 to 117,000. The
government foresters complain of the destruction of
the forests by their trampling and grazing, more than
of the valueless trees being felled to get lichen for
their food. When the rein-lichen is not found on the
tundras it takes from 60 to 100 trees to provide food
for one reindeer.

Cattle are growing in number faster than any other
animal; between 1865 and 1897 they increased from
1 to 1½ million, the cows alone increasing from
671,000 to 1,080,000; and the numbers must now
be still larger. In certain parts of the country, notably
in the backward districts of the east, it was the
custom to keep a large herd of cows, extravagantly
large in proportion to the extent of cultivated land.
There was ample pasture during the summer, and the
cattle had to get through the winter as best they could.
Now the number of cattle is increasing in the wealthier
districts and on the best managed farms, where they
are no longer regarded as a necessary evil chiefly
useful for the obtaining of manure, but as a source
of considerable profit. On the large farms we find
a mixed breed of different races. Among imported
cattle the Ayrshires are preferred, and, as in Sweden,
are found to be well suited to the pasture land of the
country. Some valuable animals have been obtained,
for instance, from the herds of the Duke of Buccleuch.
Good Ayrshire cows give about 2300 kilos of milk,
red imported Danish cows about 2900, and Jerseys an
even better result. At present the Finns have great
confidence in their own breeds, which can be improved
and developed, they think, to suit the characteristic
features of their pastures. In the north is found a
small white polled cow, closely related to the Swedish
cow from Jämtland; this is a small mountain breed,
found chiefly in the country along the Torneå and
Kemi rivers. The breed which the farmers are now
especially trying to develop is a little larger than these,
and found mostly round Kiuruvesi in the north-east.
It is light red in colour with white spots, mostly with
a white head and a white line on the back. In
Southern Finland the breed is rather larger, and more
often dark red in colour, or sometimes white with red
spots. A cow of Finnish breed usually weighs about
660 pounds and gives from 1300 to 2300 kilos of
milk per annum; the milk being fairly rich, so that
from 17 to 20 kilos go to a kilo of butter. It is a
question, however, whether the better class of farmers
will care to wait for the development of these native
breeds. At the cattle-shows to-day cows of Finnish
breed meet with especial recognition, as do also, to
some extent, the Ayrshires.

Coincidently with the increase of dairy business,
more pigs are kept; though at present there are only
some 200,000 of them. The Finnish pig is accustomed
to living in the woods and on the pasture lands, and
does not therefore fatten as rapidly and cheaply as
is desirable. The ordinary good English breeds are
being imported. The duty on maize in Finland, as in
Sweden, is a great difficulty in the way of keeping and
fattening pigs; it is 2 marks 25 p. per 100 kilos on
all maize coming from other countries than Russia,
and to bring it from Russia does not pay so well. The
duty on maize is also sufficient to prevent any profit
from poultry-keeping on a large scale, a business which
has not met with much attention in Finland. The
Danish farmers regard the free import of maize as
one of the main reasons why they are superior to
Sweden in the production of bacon and eggs, so that
they can even export both to Sweden.

The total value of domestic animals in Finland
today is more than 100,000,000 marks. The figures in
1895 were estimated to be as follows: Horses, 27
millions; reindeer, 2½ millions; sheep, 6½ millions;
cattle (including bulls and calves), 62½ millions;
swine, 4 millions; poultry, about half a million; the
total being 104 millions. The export of animals in
1899 amounted to 26⅓ million marks against an
import value of 3 millions.

For the moment the progress of the dairy business
appears to be the most important feature in Finnish
agriculture. Cheese-making has not yet become an
important item of it, though on many large farms a
good Gruyère is produced, and the manufacture of
several finer kinds has lately been attempted. But
it is the production of butter which, in Finland as
in Denmark and Sweden, has attained the greatest
importance, and yet larger results are expected.
Butter in Finland is mentioned in early Christian
times, when the bishops spoke of butter as part of
what was paid to the priest by peasants in the
islands and other parts of the country. In more
modern times, some generations ago, the peasants
in the east, in Carelia and Savolaks, understood the
art of making good butter during the summer. In
winter the cattle were too poorly fed for butter-making 
to be possible; but at this time of year
the more skilful peasants of Ostrobothnia had butter
for sale. After the hard years of 1864 and 1868
great efforts were made to arrange a larger export
of butter. At first the export consisted of peasant
butter, which naturally was not of the finest quality;
but in 1870 the use of cold water and ice, an 
excellent method first employed by Herr Swartz, on
the Hofgård near Norrköping in Sweden, was
introduced into Finland as well as into other northern
countries; and it was largely due to this that some
years later, in 1880, the owners of the “herregårdar” 
or gentlemen farmers, began to export good
butter. On the other hand, after 1870, the peasants
had less butter to sell; this was the time when
they were beginning to make more money by selling
timber, and, as a consequence, they lived more
comfortably than formerly, and the peasant butter was
consumed in the country itself. From 1868 to
1884 the export barely exceeded 5000 tons a year,
but after the latter date Finland followed the
example of Denmark and introduced large creameries,
which collect the milk of the peasants, and make
it possible, by a scientific method of production, to
realise comparatively high prices. As a consequence
of this, the cattle are better tended, especially in
winter time, and agriculture in general is improved.
In Finland to-day, as in Denmark, thousands of these
creameries have been established, many of them being
of some considerable size; and this is the case not
only in the more advanced districts of the south-west,
and in the two Ostrobothnian provinces of Vasa and
Uleåborg, but also in the once backward north-eastern
district. The Finnish creameries are not formed into
co-operative associations so often as they are in
Denmark; a relatively large number of them have been
established by men of means, who buy the milk from
their neighbours. In connection with the creameries,
some skimming-centres have been established, and
many of the peasant dairies use hand-separators and
other improved machinery. Of late, however, the
co-operative movement is spreading in Finland. An
interesting experiment is being made by Herr Arthur
Borgström, who has established a large creamery in
the port of Hangö, and who buys frozen cream, using
a method which resembles that in use in Denmark
to freeze part of the milk. From about fifty stations,
some of them hundreds of miles away, and some yet
farther off in the eastern part of the country, cream
is now sent to Hangö by railway. During the week
the peasants pour one lot of cream on another, the
whole being frozen to a soft mass; then once a week
a man takes the cream of the whole neighbourhood to
the station, so minimising the expense of transport.
The whole business of these big creameries is new
to Finland, but it is admirably worked. The machines
are foreign, partly English, and the special dairy
machinery usually comes from Denmark. The
industry, however, as has been said, is in its infancy,
and could be developed considerably by obtaining
better cows, better food, and more scientific
cultivation and rotation of the crops. The export of butter
increased to thirty million marks in 1897. It has
decreased slightly since then, merely because the
better wages and generally increased prosperity of
the past few years have permitted the people to use
more butter as well as other luxuries.

To forbid the import of margarine was a mistake;
the great consumption of it in Denmark, for instance,
increased the export of the more valuable butter.
Denmark itself, the country which has to some
extent been copied by Finland in its dairy work, has
not entirely escaped unwise legislation in this
department of its industry. The colouring of the margarine
has been forbidden, and conditions have been imposed
on its sale, some of which limitations have induced
Danish manufacturers to establish factories for 
margarine in England instead of Denmark. Finland has
not followed Denmark in its over-hasty legislation
about the Pasteurisation of the milk; legislation
which necessitated an immediate change in dairy
implements, steam-engines, boilers, and even
buildings; and this though it has not yet been decided
whether Pasteurisation decreases the value of milk
as food!

The creamery business is the highest development of
modern agriculture in Northern Europe. It does not
interfere with the production of grain; on the contrary,
as we see in Finland, this increases with the better care
and feeding of cattle. The creamery is a manufacturing
business which, in its whole character, and owing to its
demand for co-operation, presupposes a considerable
development in the education of the people; and for
the same reasons it will produce a noticeable economic
result. What has already been done in Finland testifies 
to the high state of education there. It is absolutely 
astonishing to read in a journal which is now
published simultaneously in Finnish and Russian by
an arrangement of the present Governor-General,
a series of articles asserting that the country is
being pauperised by this creamery business, which,
according to the writer, uses up all the grain and
grasses, and necessitates the importation of extra food
for cattle. The right thing to do, says this
semi-official organ of the Governor-General, is to produce
more rye, use it for the distillation of the form of
whisky known as brännvin, and use the refuse as
a cheap food for cattle. The Finns themselves, on
the contrary, hold the same opinion as the Swedes,
among others, that it has been a great step in
advance to replace the numerous small distilleries by
creameries, which are far more profitable and have
none of the evil accompaniments of distilleries. The
Finns have, as we shall see, diminished their
consumption of whisky, or brännvin, by one-half.

The total agricultural products of Finland for
1896 have been estimated at 306 million marks of
grain; 1100 litres of milk per cow, which, allowing
for 1,100,000 cows and a price of 10 <i>penni</i> per litre,
represents 121 millions of marks; and finally 50
millions for meat, eggs, &c. It ought to be possible
to double this total within the next few years; since in
Denmark the same number of cows is estimated to
produce more than double this amount of milk, or a
total of 200 million kronor against an expenditure of
150 millions; and the Danes are increasing their
production every year. The Finns have ample room for
expansion.

The Finnish government has, as a rule, ably
seconded the efforts of the farmers. In 1892 a Board
of Agriculture was established, and the government
has given advice and technical assistance, lending the
services of engineers, experts in agriculture and dairy
work, and other specialists. Models provided by
Sweden have been adopted and improved upon; and
experimental businesses have been established. For
years an excellent school, due especially to the efforts
of Herr N. Grotenfelt, has been in working order at
Mustiala; later on, as has been mentioned, another
school was established on the estate of Kronoborg, and
a whole series of dairy schools and lower-grade schools
was founded on farms belonging to the government
or on private farms. Higher grade agricultural
instruction is now being introduced at the University of
Helsingfors. It is sometimes asserted that in addition
to what has been done for the education of the
upper-class farmers and their assistants, more might have
been done for the peasants; but there is this difficulty,
that the present Russian Governor-General is not in
favour of the peasants obtaining, as they wish, a general
education together with technical knowledge. It is a
noteworthy fact that the peasants send their sons to
school in larger numbers in bad years, when there is
less to do in the country. Schools in Ostrobothnia
have very few pupils just now on account of the great
increase in emigration.

In Finland, as in other countries, much good work
has been done by private associations. The Imperial
Economic Society of Finland, with headquarters in
Åbo, was established at the end of the eighteenth
century. To-day “Hushallssallskaper” exist in each
separate province; also parish associations; a large
dairy association, which is making vigorous efforts to
organise the sale of butter in England; an association,
established in 1894, for the cultivation of peat-bogs;
and several others. Co-operative associations were
formed, too, on Danish models, not only to work
creameries, but also for other purposes, such as the
purchase of artificial manure; and a new law has been
passed laying down general regulations for them,
requiring a written agreement among the partners,
and so on. Only associations which grant loans need
government sanction. Such societies and other forms
of co-operation, with judicious assistance from the
government, contribute considerably to a country’s
progress.

Up to the present time the dwellers in the
immense Finnish Lapmark, the Finns themselves as
Avell as the few Lapps, have lived almost exclusively
on their reindeer and the proceeds of their fishing.
Now, on the representations of the Diet, a committee
has been formed to examine into their situation and to
propose measures for their improvement. Experience
proves, as the Diet points out, that barley and rye
ripen high up in the northern country, and roots grow
in the farthest north, while prairie land is certainly
plentiful; but nobody has ever thoroughly gone into
the matter or considered the possibilities of these vast
regions.

Several State funds have been formed for lending
money to establish dairies, and to cultivate
peatbogs and other unreclaimed land. Thus in 1851
such a fund was formed, and in 1885 another
of 2 million marks was voted to be lent without
interest to parish authorities, and by these re-lent in
small amounts to private persons at the low interest of
3 per cent. At the same time more money was granted
to be lent for the reclamation of moors and peat-bogs.
The first fund was exhausted very soon, 300 parishes
asking for loans, and it was decided to use
three-quarters of the second fund in a similar fashion,
lending it to the Communes at 3 per cent. By the end of
1898 rather more than 3 millions had been lent to
the parishes; and these had themselves formed funds
out of the interest received amounting to more than
750,000 marks, which they are re-lending. All this,
however, is not sufficient. The methods savour too
much of officialdom, and central control is difficult
even when the loans are arranged through the
communal authorities. In fact this low interest makes the
loan an act of charity. Up to the present time,
however, most of the capital used for agricultural
improvements has been obtained by selling timber.

It has now been decided to establish a new central
institution for lending money to co-operative
associations. The government will grant a subvention for
the cost of administration, and may also assist in other
ways. The institution, it is suggested, will require a
capital of 300,000 marks, which may later be
increased to one million; the shares being at first all
taken up by the existing co-operative associations.
It will lend them money on mortgage and personal
security, discount their bills and receive their money
on current account, or on deposit, on the same terms
as the savings banks. These measures are considered
necessary in order to assist the small farmers, who
find the ordinary banks difficult of access.

We must admit that for our own part we have
more confidence in the development of the ordinary
credit institutions, the banks with their numerous
branches, the savings banks and mortgage associations,
which would become still more useful to the small
landed proprietor if they would continue to decrease
their limit of values on which money is lent, a limit
only recently lowered from 8000 to 6000 marks.

<chapter name="V. Forestry">
<h2><small>CHAPTER V</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>FORESTRY</small></small></h2>

<sc>Finland</sc> is one of the best wooded countries in Europe.
The woods in Finland occupy a larger space than all
the pasture land contained in Great Britain and
Ireland; while Finland itself is as big as the whole
United Kingdom, with the addition of Holland and
Belgium. More than half of the country — it is said
as much as 64 per cent. — is covered by forests. The
true forest land, on dry soil, is generally reckoned at
46 per cent. of the surface of the country, or four
times as much as all the agricultural, plough and
prairie land put together. But in addition to this,
much of the remaining 54 per cent. (consisting of
morass, bogs, lake, and rock) is partially covered with
trees. Some people reckon that the marsh land in
which pines are found is 30 per cent. of the total
wooded area. The whole country is about 90 million
acres in extent, of which 36½ million acres are dry
forest land, 8½ million acres are devoted to agriculture,
and 45 millions are without much value, though
partially covered with trees. When different estimates
are made of this wooded surface it is due to the
different meanings given to the word forest. At any
rate, Finland is mainly forest land.

It is to these woods that “the land of a thousand
lakes” (or, to be more nearly accurate, of ten
thousand lakes) owes its great beauty. We who live in
more elaborately cultivated lands can hardly form an
idea of the attraction of this forest country in Finland
and Northern Scandinavia, of this beautiful mixture
of pines and firs of different ages, mingled with birches
and other deciduous trees; of this ground covered with
rich mosses, junipers, ferns, flowers, and berries, the
whole broken by lakes and rocks of fresh natural
beauty. The inhabitants of a country where only
regular and uniform plantations are found cannot fail
to be deeply and especially impressed by such a scene,
and to find this forest land, though of course its
beauty varies in different parts of this large country,
very grand and interesting.

While Finland as a whole is not agriculturally
rich, it has some magnificent natural advantages;
among others its capability of producing the trees
which are most commonly used to-day for building-material. 
The formations found on granite do not, as
a rule, make good agricultural soil, but they are an
excellent encasement for the large vertical roots of the
pine, and also for the long creeping roots stretched out
by firs. The gravel formed by glaciation, particularly
that which has been formed by brash (the Swedish
“krosstensgrus”) and also by rubble, is an excellent
soil for pines and firs. The pine is also content with
sand, marshes, and certain mosses; while the fir grows
better on wet ground. The rain everywhere is sufficient 
in quantity for the growth of the trees, and the
most valuable of them are found very far northward.
There, however, their growth and multiplication is
retarded, and even their shape is different. The fir,
instead of assuming the shape of a pyramid with
longer branches below, grows more like a column;
and the pine does not attain any great height. In
consequence, probably, of the hindrance encountered
by its strong root as it strikes vertically downwards,
the tree stops growing, and forms at its top a tuft
of branches stretching out horizontally like those of
the stone pine in Southern Europe. But even thus
the tree is valuable.

If we wish to locate the great mass of the forests
on the map, we find them, as is natural, on the higher
ground. We cannot call Finland a mountainous
country, if we thereby mean to suggest mountains of
considerable height. At all events, it is only a
comparatively small part of the country in the north
which belongs to the mountain chain of the
Scandinavian Peninsula. The greater part of the country
has, however, an elevation of 1000 feet or more above
the level of the sea, and it is here that we find the
thickest and most valuable forests; in the north, in
the west where the great plain bordering the Gulf of
Bothnia is separated by some hilly country from the
lakes of the interior, and finally on the heights near
the Russian frontier. Not much is heard nowadays
about the chains of hills in Finland, of which the
geographers used to speak; there are no continuous
chains, but only a succession of separate hills called
“Maanselkä” or “the back of the country,” which
runs across the north, and then south-eastwards until
it crosses the Russian frontier. The “Suomenselkä,”
or “the back of Finland,” has the same characteristics;
this line runs down from the “back of the country,”
from north-east to south-west, till at Sideby it reaches
the Gulf of Bothnia, and there divides Ostrobothnia
from Satakunta. It is also lines of separate hills,
and not regular chains which run down from the
Suomenselkä into the interior, and divide the great
systems of lakes there; we find the Satakunnanselkä
in Satakunta, the Hämeenselkä in Tavastland (or
Hämeenmaa, as this district is called in Finnish), the
Savonselkä in Savolaks, and the Karjalanselkä in
Carelia. A line of downs, the “Salpausselkä" or
“Closing Range,” which crosses the country in the
south, in which the above-mentioned spurs of hills
terminate, and which separates the great interior
basin from the low lands of the coast, are similarly not
a chain of mountains, but a curious terminal moraine,
consisting of sand and gravel, and with another similar
spur at a distance of a few miles. The same is the
case with the Lohjanselkä, which runs down from this
range to the south-western coast at Hango. These
and other ranges of hills are natural forest soil. The
largest and densest groups of forests are, as we have
said, situated in the north, in the west inside the
great plain, and on the eastern frontier; at which
three points, too, the great Crown forests are to be
found. But, in fact, the whole comparatively high
and thinly-populated country which divides the
Ostrobothnian rivers from those running south into the
Gulf of Finland, has been, and still is, the home of the
woods. The forests which crown the hills run down
to the coasts in the south-west; and the islands
themselves are well-wooded, though rocky, and contain
trees of considerable value.

The common pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>), the Norwegian
pine or red wood, as it is sometimes called, is
commercially the most valuable of all northern trees.
Its wood, being resinous, is strong and durable, and it
is also elastic and comparatively free from knots. The
tree is called “fura” when the stems have formed
into the beautiful straight column which is the usual
result of dense growth, the branches then falling off
cleanly without leaving knots. Otherwise “tall” is
the common Swedish name. The pine grows far up
in the Lapmark, but in the farthest north it looks
more like a bush than a tree. It grows but slowly
there. In Southern Finland, in moderately rich soil,
a pine takes eighty-two years to attain a diameter of
20 centimetres at a height of 7 metres, while in
Central Finland it takes 105 years, and in the north
below the Lapmark 131 years to reach the same size.
A larger trunk of 25 centimetres, such as would be
required at the saw-mills, takes respectively 111, 142,
and 175 years in the above-mentioned three parts of
the country. The height of a tree 100 years old is in
these three regions 25, 21, and 18 metres; or, in the
best possible soil, 33, 27, and 19 metres; or, in the
least fertile soil, 18, 15, and 9 metres. The
difference is thus very great. While it pays in the south
to let a forest grow for 120 years, it may be profitable
farther north to let it remain for 150 or 200 years;
and in the farthest north no time seems to be sufficient 
for the regrowth of a forest which has once been
cut down. The most valuable boards and planks, of
from 9 to 12 English inches, require a tree-trunk
measuring at least 10 English inches or 27
centimetres at the thin end. Wood of this measurement
is worth two or three times more per cubic foot than
when it is cut down in trunks of 18 centimetres. In
the far north, on the other side of the watershed, in
the Lake Enare district of the Lapmark, it has taken
as much as 282 to 392 years before a pine has
obtained a thickness of 25 centimetres at a height
respectively of 4 and 6 metres.

The fir (<i>Abies excelsa</i>) or Norwegian spruce is
generally less valuable than the pine; in its ordinary
dimensions it is worth on the average 20 per cent.
less than the latter. But the demand for it has
increased considerably; in particular, the extensive
modern requirement of white wood for paper-pulp and
pasteboard can be met by such trees of rather smaller
dimensions. The fir wants a better soil than the pine,
and especially it wants more moisture; but it increases
more rapidly both in quantity and in value. In 100
years, in forests of ordinary density, a fir-tree reaches
an average height of 25½ metres, or 30 metres in 160
years. It can rarely grow as old as the pine without
being spoilt, the limit in Finland being from 130 to
160 years. In Russia it grows a little farther north
than the pine; but in Finland not quite so far north;
reaching hardly to 69½° of latitude, while the pine is
not far from 70°. The fir, too, requires a longer time
to develop in the north; a trunk of 20 centimetres at
a height of 7 metres requires 162 years between the
65° and 67° of latitude; while in Central Finland it
requires 123 years, and in Southern Finland 96 years.
A trunk of 25 centimetres requires respectively in
these districts 202, 153, and 115 years. The finest
growth and the best result is obtained by a mixture
of the pine, which requires light, and the fir, which is
able to grow in the shade. It is in the north, in woods
thus arranged, that we most often meet with the long
healthy pines, as straight as the most perfect columns,
such as are rarely seen in Central Europe. The fir
helps to keep the soil moist. It is here too that good
layers of humus are found, and that the richest
growths of bacteria, mosses, and animalculæ which
form good soil are developed. It is a mistake not to
assist, when possible, the formation and preservation
of this useful admixture.

Among deciduous trees the birch predominates. In
Finland as elsewhere, in the United States for instance,
the cutting down of the forests is causing birch trees
and other less valuable hardwood trees to replace the
resinous trees. The latter, and especially the fir,
return when the forest is let alone. The birch is
found nearly everywhere in Finland, even quite far
north; farthest north of all being found the little
dwarf birch (<i>Betula nana</i>), which grows higher up in
the mountains than the pine or fir. The peculiarly
beautiful weeping birch predominates in a large part
of the islands, and is also common in the southern
and central parts of the country. In addition to being
employed as firewood, birch is used for the
manufacture of bobbins, now rather an important industry.

Of the two varieties of alder, the common red alder
(<i>Alnus glutinosa</i>) grows largely among the swamps of
the south, and far up along the rivers and coast. The
hoary and wavy-leafed species (<i>Alnus incana</i>)
predominates in the north, chiefly in central and eastern
Finland, where, on burnt-over lands, it is sometimes
more prevalent than the birch.

The aspen is found almost as far north as the birch,
but rarely in any dense growth. Latterly its wood has
been in especial request in match factories.

Among other trees the mountain ash, which in olden
times was regarded even more than the birch as a holy
tree, extends far up north. Among several service
trees, one is known as the Lapland variety. Two other
varieties, the bastard service and the Scandia service,
are found only in the south-west, especially in Åland.
Still farther north, we find a number of willows,
including the cracking willow, and about twenty varieties of
osiers. The most northerly limit of linden (<i>Tilia ulmifolia</i>) 
and hazel is comparatively far down, and for elm,
Norwegian maple (<i>Acer platanoides</i>), and ash, it is even
farther down on the southern coast. We find oak on
the southern coast only, <i>e.g.</i>, on Runsala island near
Åbo, and farther down on the south-western coast, and
in the province of Viborg. Interesting experiments are
being made in sowing and planting the larch, which
grows very far north, and of which an interesting
plantation was formed in the first part of the
eighteenth century by the Russian Marine Administration 
in the parish of Nykyrka, in the south-eastern
corner of Finland. Experiments are now being made
with the Weymouth pine, silver fir, white fir, “Balm
of Gilead” or balsam fir, <i>Pinus strobus</i>, <i>Pinus cembra</i>,
and the Douglas spruce from the North American
Pacific coast. Yet other trees and bushes are found
in the north, the Guelder Rose or viburnum, one of
the buckthorns, the brackwood and others. In the
south-western corner of the country, especially on the
islands, a richer and more varied vegetation is found,
buckthorns and blackthorns, hawthorns, lime-trees,
bird-cherries, crab-apples, yews, honeysuckle, a few
sloes, and a number of roses. In the gardens we meet
several kinds of poplars (including the abele tree or
white poplar and the balsam poplar), horse-chestnuts,
lilacs, spinæas, snowberries, barberries, apples, cherries
and smaller fruits, among which the black currant,
gooseberry and raspberry extend comparatively far
northwards. Some of the most perfect rose gardens
are found in this northern country.

In the woods of Finland and on its moors and
marshes, as well as in Sweden and Norway, we find
a large abundance of berries — strawberries, raspberries,
bilberries, whortleberries, cranberries, and the excellent
cloudberries (<i>Rubus chamæmorus</i>), and roebuck berries
(<i>Rubus arcticus</i>). The peasants and cottiers frequently
used to pay, and even still pay, part of their rent in
berries. Fruit in the south is sweeter, in the north
more aromatic. In the United States, all these berries,
especially the large variety of cranberries, bring in
millions of dollars to those who cultivate and pick
them. In New Jersey and Wisconsin the cranberry
marshes are sometimes cultivated; that is to say,
provided with a layer of sand, and kept under water during
certain periods to protect them against frost.
Considering the whole fruit trade, and especially the tinned
fruit trade of the United States, we cannot but wonder
whether this great abundance of berries in Northern
Europe might not be dealt with in the same manner,
and not as now be left to bring in merely a few
thousand marks. To make such an industry succeed it would
probably be necessary to remove the duty on tin and
tin-dipped iron for boxes, and to allow the free import
of sugar, or at least to pay the duty back in the case
of exports.

Nothing in Finland is more noticeable to the
foreigner than the waste of timber. Not long ago in
Northern Tavastland, and still later in Carelia, it was
thought good policy to burn the old pine woods simply
in order that they might be changed to pasture land
or into plantations of deciduous trees, which later
could be used in the so-called “svedja” agriculture.
Rather than lose the skin of a squirrel a hunter would
without hesitation fell the finest tree. Even to-day
an incredible waste goes on, trees being felled for the
construction of fences which, as in Sweden, are formed
of slanting posts; and yet more are felled for firewood.
The great mass of wood in Finland is used at home,
only a comparatively small part being exported. Out
of 19 million cubic metres, the minimum yearly crop,
more than 13 million metres is so consumed, besides
what the cottagers use in the government forests,
and in addition to more than 2 million cubic metres
used in factories, and on railways and steamers. Some
improvement is, however, visible; in especial the idea
of a necessary consumption has been changed, and it
is characteristic to notice how calculations vary in
different places. In the east, in the provinces of Kuopio
and St. Michel, the necessary quantity per head is
reckoned at ten cubic metres, while in the south-west it
is only six. On a peasant farm in the comparatively
advanced province of Nyland, it is still reckoned
necessary to use 123 cubic metres per annum, while for a
town house 14 is considered sufficient. In the interior
of Vasa the amount is 190 cubic metres, and in the
coast district only 64 per farm. Notwithstanding
many improvements, such as better-made ovens and
so on, waste is still the rule, and we find the same
thing in all countries where timber is plentiful and its
value small.

The old agricultural method of which we have
spoken, which obtains a few harvests and some pasture
afterwards by burning over the forest lands, was
certainly false economy. In a large part of the country
this method has entirely changed the character of
the forests. This is the case in the old district of
Savolaks, that is in the existing provinces of St.
Michel and Southern Kuopio, and also in other parts
of the country. Instead of dense pine woods we find
woods of birch with a few pines, and more aspen trees,
and the wavy-leaved alder. It is not till the
birch-trees are thirty or forty years old that the woods begin
to grow thin, and are open enough to leave room for a
new growth of fir and pine, especially fir. The aspen
leaves sufficient room when it is twenty years old, the
alder not till it is eighty or a hundred. Usually,
however, where this burning has prevailed, the deciduous
forest has not been allowed to attain such an age. It
may be right for the Legislature to take up the matter
and try to abolish this old and evil practice, as it has
done by the law of 1886, already referred to, which
forbade all burning on rock, on very stony land, and
on sands covered by pine or heath. We doubt,
however, the wisdom of the clause which forbids such
cultivators to take more than two harvests of grain,
and lays down a rule that deciduous woods must not
be burnt again for thirty years, or resinous woods for
forty years. We think still worse of the proposal of
the late committee, that resinous forest should not be
burned over at all for the future, and of the clause in
the present forest law which forbids even the waste
left after timber-felling to be burnt over for the
purpose of sowing grain, unless the land is immediately
afterwards used for pasture or replanted as forest. We
can better understand the committee’s desire to forbid
the burning of all heath land. But the burning of
waste and dry mosses left after the old trees have been
felled may be most desirable. On dry soil and dry
moss it may be difficult to make the seeds of the trees
sprout, or to preserve the young growth, while on the
other hand it may be very profitable to take several
rich harvests without burning the soil itself, and
afterwards to obtain some good pasturage. In a country
like Finland there is always an abundance of miserable
old pasture land, often covered with ling and heath,
where good forests may be produced at very small
cost. The soil is firm and moist enough to allow the
seed to sprout and the young growth to thrive. The
old svedja is wasteful and antiquated, but burning
may, on the other hand, be of excellent service in
forestry, and it ought not to be forbidden. It is
worthy of note that the restrictions are not always
regarded, an inevitable result of legislative interference
with free popular transaction of business.

The manufacture of tar, in the old fashion, is no
less antiquated and wasteful than the svedja. 
Enormous tracts of pine-wood, especially in Uleåborg and in
the interior of Vasa, have been destroyed or changed
into fir-woods because the pines have been cut down
when they are from forty to eighty years old and used
for burning tar. This has been an important business
in Ostrobothnia since the sixteenth century. For
several successive years the trees are stripped of their
bark, except one small strip just big enough to keep the
tree alive, which is left on the north side. The last
year this too is taken off, and the trees are felled, cut
up, and then charred in a pit or kiln in which the tar
is collected. Better kilns are now used, though not
so widely as in Russia, and to some extent the
tar-burners make use of less extravagant material, such as
stumps, roots, waste from the saw-mills, and young
trees cut down when the forest-growth is thinned;
the latter being indeed material for which it would
be difficult to find any other use. Most of the tar,
however, is produced by the old wasteful methods;
tar-burning to-day still consumes some 300,000 cubic
metres of wood and not less than 700,000 stems per
annum; and it is still the main business of the people
on the other side of Lake Uleå. It is, however, no
matter for regret that the export of tar in the
nineteenth century, particularly in its last decade, should
have diminished considerably. There is less use for
it now that wooden ships have been replaced by ships
of iron and steel. When the production of tar was at
its height in 1863, after having stopped almost entirely
during the Crimean War, the amount was not far
short of 300,000 hectolitres per annum; in 1875 it
was a little over 200,000 hectolitres, and its value was
3 million marks; now the production is not much
more than 100,000 hectolitres. Besides the tar itself
this industry results in some minor products, such as
pitch, lampblack, and charcoal, and, with modern appliances, 
yet others such as methylated spirit, wood-oil, and
acid-chalk. The production of potash is less than
formerly. Doubtless considerable improvement is possible.

The chief products of the forest now go through
the saw-mills. In 1889 about 373,000 cubic metres
of planks were exported, the value being about 16
million marks; also 850,000 cubic metres of battens
of the value of 32 million marks; one million cubic
metres of boards of the value of 31 million marks ;
a little over 300,000 cubic metres of staves, bottoms,
and ends of planks; boards of the value of 3 million
marks; and a smaller amount of sawn spars. The
total value was about 82 million marks.

The exportation of hewn spars or beams in 1899
was valued at 2,134,000 marks; of laths and
lath-work at 1,380,000 marks; of round spars, bowsprits,
yards, masts, &c., at 1,863,000 marks; the whole of
this class of ware representing about 300,000 cubic
metres and 5 million marks. Pit-props were exported
to the value of about 3 millions; and wood for
pulp-mills and paper factories to the value of about 2½
millions; making altogether about 750,000 cubic
metres and 5½ million marks. About 500,000 cubic
metres of firewood, both fir and pine, worth about 1¾ 
million marks, was exported; and firewood of other
trees in rather less quantity but of about the same
value. Squares of birch for bobbins were exported to
the value of 250,000 marks, and bobbins themselves
to the value of 2 millions. Besides these a considerable 
list might be compiled of other more or less important 
articles, such as poles, rafters, beams, knees of
fir for keels, other items for shipbuilding, and various
other manufactured articles. The value of the whole
bulk of wood hewn or manufactured in the saw-mills
amounted in 1899 to the large sum of 101 million
marks. To this may be added the export of pulp,
pasteboard, and paper, representing about 300,000
cubic metres of wood and a value of 18 million marks.
To this purpose a great mass of the wood of the United
States and other countries is nowadays applied, in
consequence of the rapidly increasing production of
newspapers. No industry is better suited to Finland,
Sweden, and Norway, with their great fir-woods and
excellent water-power. But the production of wood
so used is very little compared with the domestic
consumption, and it is a small part of the wood exported.
The whole of the exported wood (about 4 million
cubic metres) does not amount to much more than
one-fourth of the wood consumed in the country, which
is about 15 million cubic metres.

The great export of timber is a comparatively new
business. Formerly it was sawn by hand, or by
water-power if it could be found, and the manufactured
product was conveyed to the ports, usually by cart and
horse, at great cost. Not until after the Crimean War
was steam power allowed at the saw-mills, and it then
became the practice to build mills at the mouths of big
rivers, so that great quantities of wood might be floated
there and work be done on a large scale. In 1861
the regulation was rescinded which, partly for the
preservation of the forests, had restricted the territory
from which each saw-mill might buy wood, and also
the number of trunks and logs which it might saw
each year. In 1846 the total value of exported
lumber was 2,200,000 marks, which represented a
quarter of the total exports of that time; and
three-quarters of this came from the saw-mills. In 1856
this total was increased to 5½ millions, representing
one-third of the total export; and of this amount
17-20ths was manufactured in the saw-mills. The
greatest progress took place after the Franco-German
War, when the large demand for wood in these speculative 
times — the “milliard period” — led foreigners to
place a considerable amount of capital in the lumber
business, and when large saw-mills were built on the
rivers. In the five years from 1875-79 the export
increased till it was one-half larger than in the
preceding five years. In 1877 it was three times as
large as in 1870. It decreased during the Russo-Turkish 
War, but in 1880 it was larger than it had
ever been. These periods do not exactly follow the
economic movements of the world. With wood, as
with iron, a demand continues after the period of
prosperity, on account of buildings begun and
contracts made during this period, although the periodic
reaction in the level of prices has begun. It takes
also a long time, sometimes as much as four years, for
the felled trees to come, first, out of the forests into
the interior lakes and rivers, then to the saw-mills,
and finally thence into foreign countries. The large
recent increase in the value of this export, an increase
from 50,000,000 marks in the prosperous year of
1876 and 40,500,000 as late as 1892 to 101,000,000
in 1899, is largely the result of the general
economic development of the world, and of the greater
demand which has increased the price. But it has
only been made possible by the Finlanders’ ability to
produce. It is an advance which will continue, even
though a reaction may take place at certain periods.
In quantity, timber from the saw-mills has increased
from less than half a million cubic metres per annum
in 1865-69, to more than a million per annum in the
period 1875-84, 1¾ million in 1894, and more than
2½ millions in 1899-1900.

Private owners, it must be confessed, are in the
habit of destroying their woods. In Finland private
landlords own about 24 million acres of dry forest soil,
and 4¼ million acres of wooded marsh land. These
figures represent respectively 44 per cent. and 8 per
cent. of the whole area of land held as private
property; the rest being 5 per cent. of plough land, 10½
per cent. of pasturage, and 32 per cent. of barren
marshes and rocks. In all countries the great
virginal forests are cut down as soon as they become
valuable; in the United States, for instance, enormous
natural forests have very quickly disappeared. In the
northern portion of the east, especially in the State
of Maine, most of which is forest land, there is now
hardly any wood except the second growth. Also in
the other large forest-tracts of Weymouth pine, at the
western end of the Great Lakes, the virginal forest is
nearly all cut down. The same will soon be the case
with the Douglas spruce in the northern part of the
Pacific coast, as well as the pitch-pine and other
valuable woods in the forest area of the Southern States,
this latter being the largest area of untouched forest
in existence in the United States. Only in Canada
will a large area of woods remain for some time longer
untouched. In the forests of the Scandinavian
Peninsula, too, especially in Norway, the trees have now
been thinned out in the most serious manner; and
even on the coast of Northern Sweden the large
trunks have been taken away. In Finland it is not
only the very big trunks which are used directly
transport becomes possible; the small ones too are
utilised. In 1887 less than thirty trunks were
required to produce manufactured wood which should
fill a standard of St. Petersburg measure; but in 1897
it took forty-two trunks. In the interior all stems of
20 centimetres in diameter at a height of 5 metres are
cut down; on the coast and near the railway 15
centimetres is considered a proper diameter. Buyers soon
get used to smaller dimensions, and will now, for
instance, accept a plank 3 inches by 2½ inches, English
measure, because two such planks can be used where
formerly one of 6 inches by 2½ inches was necessary.
The export of pit-props or mining lumber and wood
for the manufacture of pulp and pasteboard, is new;
in 1885 such exports only reached 8600 cubic metres
in quantity and a value of less than 200,000 marks,
while in 1900 the quantity was about a million cubic
metres and the value 6 million marks.

The peasant proprietors especially are said to sell
their timber as soon as possible. And why should
they not do so when it is more profitable for them to
have the money? Without the money obtained in
recent years for timber the remarkable agricultural
progress which we have described could not have
taken place. All men have not employed their
money equally well; but this is the case with the
owners of most other capital and income. Complaints 
are made, particularly of the poorer peasants,
that they are too willing to sell their woods at a low
price; but for them capital is of even more
importance. The woods are best managed in those districts
where agriculture is most advanced and where wood
has most value, such as Nyland, Finland proper, even
Åland, and part of Tavastland, which is still comparatively 
rich in timber. In truth, the best forests are
found where the widely scattered woods and old trees,
which latter are mostly damaged, have been once or
twice cleared away. From the point of view of their
own interest the peasants in Finland and the
Scandinavian Peninsula show no little intelligence in the
management of their timber. Often enough they
understand better than their superiors how to make
a profit out of it.

The committee appointed to inquire into the state
of the forests has several times recommended that a
small duty should be imposed on exports of small sizes
of wood such as mining timber or of wood for the
manufacture of pulp and pasteboard. It was proposed
that 10 per cent. should be paid, which for wood of
this kind at its ordinary value would work out at
about 15 penni per cubic metre. The large lumber
which has not passed through the saw-mills pays now
45 penni per cubic metre, or about 5 per cent. on the
value of the unfelled timber, and the saw-mills pay
a duty which is estimated to amount to the same.
Instead of imposing such a new duty, which the late
Forest Committee has also recommended, it would be
better to abolish all duties on the exports, including
that on manufactured goods from the saw-mills. The
more money made by timber the greater is the
encouragement to preserve and cultivate the forests.
This is good logic, and any duty which decreases value
is evidently wrong.

The enclosure and distribution of what were once
the common forests, first among parishes and villages,
and then among single proprietors, has contributed,
as a rule, to increase the interest of these persons in
their forests. It is only natural that, when enclosure
has been decided upon, the peasants should sometimes
indulge in a little license before the enclosure takes
place. The law of 1886 tried to prohibit sales during
the process of enclosure, and even authorised the
provincial governors to regulate the use of the forest
by the peasants during such periods. Sometimes the
allotment of a distant piece of land has been a reason
for the peasants to sell their forest property as rapidly
as possible.

A large extent of woods, about 100,000 acres in
all, is owned by some towns, especially in the north
and east. Recently it has been thought advisable
to preserve forests held in common ownership by
parishes, villages, or other societies. Such common
woods may be retained by the village at the time of
the enclosure, or the government may grant this
forest territory to the peasants for a reasonable rent
or price. The provincial Governor has to approve the
plan for the utilisation of the forests, after hearing
what the department of the State forests has to say.
The late committee recommended that when a
decision had to be taken about preserving half of the
forest for the village, unanimity should not be essential,
but only a two-thirds majority be required. The fact
is, however, that the peasants are not greatly
concerned about common property; they do not agree
with their theory-loving friends. Up to the present
time they have not made much use of the legislation
on the subject.

In theory it may be right to prevent the abuse of
their own property by people who do not know what
is good for them; and there may not, therefore, be any
abstract objection to a repetition in the Forest Law of
1886 of the old Swedish law forbidding peasants or
owners to destroy their forests, and compelling them,
if they do not use the soil in any other way, to
leave some trees for seed, and otherwise attend to
the regeneration of the forest. The committee which
has inquired into the situation of the private forests
recommends that, in order to supervise the woods
better, men proposed by the parish should be
nominated by the Governor to form committees of 
supervision for this purpose. We doubt whether proprietors
would like such supervision by their neighbours.

It is a matter for congratulation that the Finnish
legislators have not adopted the clauses of certain
new Swedish laws passed for the Island of Gotland
and the north coast of Sweden, which forbid the
exportation of wood of small size. The best forestry
demands the thinning as well as the cutting-down of
shut-in, badly-developed trees. To fell the trees over
an entire area is not considered good policy; but we
must repeat that it is bad economy to leave
badly-grown, stunted trees. Yet to make the business pay
requires good management in the felling, transport,
and sale of the trees, and this is often best obtained
when the work is done on a large scale. Frequently
it is necessary to construct roads, lay down rails and
use light movable tramways, which are a serious affair
for the small proprietor, and it is doubtful whether
the committee is right in trying to stop exploitation
on a large scale. At all events it seems a mistake
thus to restrict private enterprise. The Finlanders
are perhaps less hostile to the intervention of
middlemen than certain other more prejudiced nations, but
even they complain of the middlemen buying forest
lots to re-sell to third parties. They hardly sufficiently
realise the benefits of commerce, or understand that it
is only trade which gives value to the forests. It is
not sufficient for the forest to exist; the owners must
know how to sell it, to collect the scattered material,
and to take advantage of the movements of the market.

In Finland, as in Sweden, the purchase and tenure
of forests and forest property by joint-stock companies
has been spoken of as a danger. In the Swedish
provinces of North and West Botten such companies
are said to hold respectively 21 and 13 per cent. of
the land. In Finland the amount is not so much,
but there, too, they have acquired about 2000 farms.
Sometimes they only work the forests and sell the
farms; sometimes they retain and sublet the farms or
grow hay on the land. As a rule, such companies
treat their woods better than the peasants, often
managing them according to the most scientific
methods of forestry; and it may be stated, as a general
rule, that forestry is one of those rare kinds of
business which can be worked better by a large proprietor
than a small one. Now, most of the large properties,
which, as we have seen, are not very numerous, are
found in the well-cultivated parts of Finland, not
especially in the forest country. Here, in the north,
in Kuopio, Eastern Vasa, and Northern Tavastehus, is
the part where the companies have bought land; in
one part of Kuopio they have bought a whole small
village. A company usually has the capital which is
necessary for the long business of bringing down the
lumber, and also for enabling the vendor to wait for
the best market. We will not here lay stress on the
democratic nature of the joint-stock company; its
shares are the means by which the people can take
part in the acquisition and holding of land. But even
if the forest property is bought with the intention
of felling the whole forest and perhaps selling the
land, this may be just the right thing to do, for many
public and private reasons. We have spoken, too,
about the participation of foreigners in forming these
companies, and thereby acquiring land; to get foreign
capital into the country is a well-appreciated advantage.
If the peasants sell their farms to the companies and
themselves prefer to be tenant-farmers or even carters
and timber-floaters under the company, they do it, as
a rule, because it is more advantageous for all parties.

The power to register a contract about the sale of
timber only, and not land, with the right of mortgage,
is a step in advance; there is thus no need to sell the
land too, where such a sale is not desirable, but only
to obtain security for the mortgage.

Misfortunes such as forest fires and destructive
winds occur after the felling of the timber. A
dried-up waste easily takes fire and burns freely; also it
is overrun by insects, and the clearance of the trees
gives access to the wind. Fire is certainly the worst
evil. It is a question, however, whether fires increase
with cultivation. In the United States, in Illinois and
Southern Wisconsin, for instance, we have seen large
tracts of country becoming gradually covered with
trees because the prairie fires no longer overrun the
country every autumn as in the time of the Indians,
destroying young seedlings everywhere except on the
wet borders of lakes and rivers. In Finland in former
times fires were very frequent on account of acts
of negligence in lighting fires, and even more on
account of the burning-over of the land, which has
thus destroyed a far greater part of the forest than
was intended. As a rule, in spite of the risks
attendant on the lumber-man’s work, fires are much less
numerous and destructive than formerly, though they
are still a great danger. Our readers must have seen
a forest fire to understand what it really is. It
resembles to some extent a heath or prairie fire, running
over the soil and killing, though not always entirely
destroying, a large number of trees; only some of the
older pine-trees being able to withstand it. In Finland
particularly, fires have destroyed dense forests of pine
and fir over large tracts of country, changing them into
woods of less valuable deciduous trees; though in some
cases the burnt forest was rapidly replaced by young
resinous trees. Terribly destructive winds also were
experienced in 1866, 1873, 1890, and 1897. The
gale of 1890 enabled the peasants in parts of Southern
Finland to get a good supply of wood with which to
build themselves houses.

Fortunately the law in Finland has not forbidden
grazing in the woods. This would have been an
unpractical restriction, impossible to maintain.
Cattle-grazing is also a considerable aid in the reproduction
of the forest. From the far north come complaints
of the reindeer interfering with young plants by
their trampling, and destroying great quantities of
young trees by scraping them with their horns. Here,
too, a certain amount of grazing is helpful to the
growing trees in places where there is an abundance of
reindeer lichen; but hard grazing dries up the soil, to
the great detriment even of the older trees. Hundreds
of thousands of spruce are felled to obtain lichen
during the winter when there is not enough on the
ground; special men are engaged on this work; but
it is no great loss, because they only cut down the
unhealthy valueless trees on the marshes. In some
northern districts an extravagant number of trees are
cut down to obtain small fir branches to place under
the cattle. Millions of cart-loads of moss are taken
away for the same purpose, or to fill up joints in
wooden buildings, but this does not hurt the forest.
We hear sometimes of damage done by pigs to the
growing woods near the villages; but every one knows
that it is especially the pasturage of sheep and horses
which does harm to the young plants. And as
complaints about the sheep have only come as yet
from the island of Åland, we realise that the
Finlanders are not very far advanced in the science of
forestry.

The province of Uleåborg, which forms the northern
part of the country, contains about half of all the land
in Finland. Even up here there are great stretches
of well-cultivated land near the coast; and on
the sandy sub-soil which we meet here in one part
of the country, we find the celebrated prairies of
Limingo. But in the east of this same district of
Uleå, which extends from the Gulf of Bothnia to
the Russian frontier, we find in the parish of Kuusamo
an immense forest which even now has not been fully
explored. At the enclosure, communal land here to
the extent of 82,000 acres was reserved for two
parishes. In the interior, in the district of Kajana,
people have lived, and still largely live, by burning tar
in the forest. We may well be astonished, however,
to learn that in this part of the country, with its
immense tracts of woods, there are continual complaints
about a lack of timber. We do not refer only to
the buildings on the coast, where, as in Iceland,
dwelling-houses are made of turf because there is so
little timber; it is from parishes where the peasants
hold some 5000 acres of forest each, from Upper
Torneå, for instance, that complaints come of a lack of
wood, with the result that the government has granted
each man from 1200 to 2500 acres of Crown forest.
A good many of the peasants have met this liberal
treatment by an immediate sale of all their heavy
timber, the contract being usually that a loan is
granted without interest, which they must repay by
delivering wood. In certain parishes with large
forests the peasants, owing to their bad economy, have
now nothing to sell from the woods except the osier
bark. The destruction of the forests began in this
part of the country and continued in the Lapmark,
on the only land there which, so far, has been divided
between the Crown and the parish authorities.
Destruction of the forest in these parts is so much
the more dangerous because regeneration is extremely
slow and difficult. In the Lapmark there are large
areas of old woodland where the forests have been
destroyed, and at the end of several generations show
no signs of fresh growth. In this country there is
indeed need for the forester’s art.

Of two kinds of State interference in forest business
the Finlanders have fortunately chosen State
ownership, instead of interference with private ownership.
As we have already pointed out, the State has from
the first asserted its rights over all waste land,
retaining not only the greater part of those northern
territories where practically nobody lives, or only a few
nomads are found with their reindeer, but also what
was left after an enclosure had been made and the
peasants had obtained their 750, 1200, or 2000 acres,
or as much as they could readily use. It is thus that
the Crown has obtained its enormous property of 35
million acres. In 1875 it amounted to 37½ millions,
but since then large areas have been given to the
peasants in addition to what they got at the
enclosures. There arises a question of great importance to
forest cultivation, one to which we have already alluded
and would now come back — whether large allotments
are for the future to be granted to settlers. Lest we
should seem to exaggerate the value of these Crown
properties, we must explain that 31¼ out of these 35
million acres are situated in the northern province of
Uleåborg, where indeed the Crown owns three-quarters
of the soil. Much of the land here is entirely
unproductive, even if it is not all peat-bog, marshes, or
rocks. On the other hand, there is a large area
well suited for forest-growth; and on the whole the
State property is exactly in those regions which are
suitable for forests, and where, as already mentioned,
there is only a small population. Others of these
Crown lands are on the heights of the interior of
Vasa and in the east of Kuopio and Viborg.
Fourteen million acres of the entire total is dry forest soil,
and 21 millions bogs, rocks, and water. Some of the
bogs and marshes, however, produce timber, their area
being reckoned in 1869 at 5 million acres. Barely
8¾ million acres of forest are located where at present
they are profitable. On another 3 million acres are
found young trees, or soil capable of producing
valuable timber.

Not till 1850—51 was it decided to establish a
proper forest administration. In earlier times officials
were appointed chiefly to look after the hunting and
shooting; in other respects the State property, even
when finally separated from the common lands of the
peasants, was managed by the regular district officials.
Business such as the organisation of farms which
could pay taxes was of greater public interest. Baron
Edmund von Berg, the President of the renowned
Forest School of Tharand in Saxony, was now
summoned, and it was on his advice (which, however, was
only partially followed) that an Administration for
the Forests was established in 1859, with additions
made in 1863. That this is not yet sufficient is due,
among other causes, to the enormous size of the
districts under its control, there being four districts of
more than 3¾ million acres, twelve of over 250,000
acres, twenty-five of over 60,000 acres, and nine of
a smaller extent. The forest guards are numerous
compared to the foresters at the head of the districts,
but these guards are uneducated men with a very
small salary. Up to the present time little has been
done besides preserving the forests and selling the
heavy timber for the benefit of the Treasury.
Formerly this Crown property had been used by
everybody pretty much as they pleased.

In 1863 a School of Forestry was established at
Evois, but instruction here was occasionally checked
by an insufficiency of pupils. Lately the school has
been extended and a course of instruction in forestry
has been suggested at the University of Helsingfors, it
being generally admitted that advanced studies are
more profitably carried on at a university than in
isolated schools. A much-needed course of instruction 
for the forest guards has also been instituted;
and it is proposed to establish a station for
experimental forestry, as has been done for agriculture.
Every year small grants of money are distributed
through the agricultural societies for the promotion of
forest cultivation, which can hardly yet be said to exist.
The State foresters are allowed to assist private persons
in drawing up schemes of growth and other work.

The principal question for the future will certainly
be to what extent land fit for agriculture and for
settlement is to be separated, as decided by recent
laws, and furthermore, how much forest land shall be
granted to each settler. The importance of such laws
depends to a great extent on how they are applied.
If the Crown forest land is to be treated as a
commercial undertaking, commercial value must be the
principal consideration. That ought to be the object
of the million of acres which have been put aside as
“Kronoparks,“ that is to say, for regular forest-growing.
We need not speak of the Crown parks maintained for
the public benefit on account of their beauty, such as
those near the great waterfall of Imatra and near one
of the lakes at Punkaharju.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries a
theory was held that the forests ought to be given
up to the interest of the mines and factories. This
was in accordance with the common protectionist
principles of the time, according to which these
mines and factories were supposed to be for the
benefit of the country, even if they did not pay, but
on the contrary cost more than they brought in. Now
the great question is, what to do for the peasants who
desire to utilise the land.

Such thoughts seem to have influenced the action
of the government even when they had under
consideration the question of purchasing the forests in the
public interest. It was not only at the time of the
general enclosure that the government acquired land.
On the recommendation of the Forest Committee of
1874, land was bought during the period of 1874-95
in those parts of the country where the government
thought it desirable to preserve the woods, and where
ground fit for this purpose was to be had; as, for
instance, in East Vasa, in South-West Åbo-Björneborg,
in South-East Tavastehus, and in St. Michel. For
about one million marks 170,000 acres was acquired.
To this must be added 425,000 acres reserved as
Crown parks when the donation estates in East and
North Viborg were purchased from the Russian nobles,
of which area 83,000 acres are still reserved for
peasants who may desire to buy them after paying for
their farms. Not only this work of purchasing forests
but the whole work of separating the agricultural land
from the forests, and especially the forming of Crown
parks for forest cultivation, has been stopped since
1895.

To what extent ought land to be granted to settlers
without payment? In the United States the best
cultivators, and those who produce the wheat and
maize of the country, are not the “homesteaders”
or settlers who obtain their land for nothing, and
are only obliged to cultivate a small part of it for five
years; it is rather the men who buy their land from
these settlers or from the railway companies which,
during one period, obtained large grants of land
from the government. In Finland complaints,
apparently well-grounded, are heard of settlers who tried
to obtain land simply in order to re-sell the woods
which were given to them so liberally for almost
nothing. The more recent laws reserve to the Forest
Administration the right to sell all full-grown timber
for ten years; but such reservation is hardly sufficient.
There is scarcely any opportunity, for instance, of
selling scattered outlying trees. The Forest Administration 
is doubtless right when it recommends that
these free gifts of agricultural land and large tracts of
forest should be discontinued. In Sweden the
government has been obliged to repurchase large areas of
land from the settlers in Jämtland, who had got them
for nothing, and whose rights in the forest clashed
with the right of the Lapps to use the forest pastures
for their reindeer. A new provincial law in Sweden
has tried to check the settlers’ prompt destruction of
their woods, by an order that they must cut trees only
under the direction of the Forest Administration. It
has been proposed to imitate this proceeding in
Finland, but it would be better not to give away these
large tracts of forest, and so avoid subsequent
interference with natural liberty. Such restrictions rarely
answer; and where it is in the public interest to
preserve and manage the forests it is better for the State
to do the work itself. This fact is not sufficiently
recognised in the matter of the settlers; their too
liberal treatment is mainly a result of modern false
sentimentality. Men in authority are by no means
the last among those who profess democratic views
and wish to be friends of the peasants, even where
their action violates common sense. In the far north
it would be especially detrimental to the country to
destroy what is still left of the woods. The larger
part of the Lapmark forests still await division between
the Crown and the peasants, but even where the work
has been done it is important to guard the rights of
the Crown. The Lapmark is a vast territory extending 
through three degrees of latitude, and hardly used
for anything but reindeer pasture. The government
has been recommended to keep a belt of land 32
kilometres broad on the northern edge of the forest.
A division of the forest between Crown and peasants
is desired here too, so that the trees may be utilised;
already many are becoming valuable, and the great
majority are rotting and losing their value on account
of their age.

Besides the regular forest cultivation there is
other work of great and probably equal importance.
The draining of large or small areas, among other
matters, is often extremely profitable. In 1869 it
was computed that at least 1¼ million acres ought to
be drained; this being often necessary simply to
preserve the existing trees. If nothing is done it
seems that the mosses often grow so rapidly as to
kill the trees, or at least to render the soil too
damp for forest cultivation. In many large districts
the majority of the trees are, it appears, skeletons,
that is to say, they are dead wood. Some improvement, 
not less radical, is needed in the system of
floating off the trunks and logs. In some places it is
necessary to prevent private persons from establishing
a practical monopoly in the business of floating wood,
whereby they gain complete control of the woods. We
shall have to refer to this matter later.

Of some interest, too, is the work done for the
“boställen” or farms belonging to the Crown in the
provinces, about which we have already spoken. The
greater number of these, formerly occupied by officers
of the old Swedish army who were supported by these
lands, have since 1863 been subject to the
supervision of the Forest Administration. These farms are
about 800 in number with an area of 650,000 acres;
they comprise also about 390,000 acres of forest and
85,000 acres of marshes. Since 1896 about fifty
other State farms, comprising about 40,000 acres of
woods, have also been placed under the supervision of
this administration, and the case will soon be the
same with the glebe land of 700 rectories and vicarages,
comprising 482,000 acres of dry soil and 115,000
acres of marsh land. This supervision is in the interest
of the tenants, including the pastors. Up to date only
35,000 acres have been taken from these farms to be
reserved as Crown parks and forests.

On the government domains the big trees have
been counted. In 1860 it was estimated that there
were about nine million pines large enough to furnish
big logs; that is to say, trees 25 centimetres in
diameter at a height of 6 metres. In addition there
were five million trees large enough for railway-sleepers,
that is, trees 18 centimetres in diameter at a height
of 6 metres. Later on more exact measurements were
made, the result giving 26½ million first-class trees and
30 million second-class trees; and if we include the
woods where the trees are not numbered, but where
their bulk is approximately calculated, the total number
of measured trees in the two classes are estimated
respectively at 34½ and 45 millions. This is not much
for such an enormous area, being only one first-class
tree and 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> second-class tree per acre; even if we
calculate the numbers on the dry ground alone they are
only 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> and 3<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub>. Nevertheless there are large districts
where we find nineteen large trees per acre. For the
trees sold, the average price during the period 1861-95
has been 2 marks 14 penni per tree, or 4 marks 77
penni per cubic metre. In the richer districts the price
has been 6 marks 58 penni per cubic metre. Now the
price has gone up considerably, even in the far north,
where it was once almost impossible to sell timber.
In some districts as much as 16 marks per tree has
been obtained, a price which is high even when the
present price of boards and deals is allowed for, and
can be explained only by the purchasers being obliged
to obtain large trees in order to fulfil some foreign
order. At all events, these 80 million trees
represent, at present prices, a capital of more than 100
million marks. The Crown forests themselves are
probably now worth 200 millions. During the years
1874-83 they furnished to the saw-mills on an average
10½ per cent. of the logs used there, and from 1884
to 1893 14 per cent. In bulk, however, it was
probably double this amount, because the trunks and
logs from the Crown forests are considerably larger
than those from private woods. In 1898 the value
of the total amount of wood sold from the Crown
forests was 2,820,000 marks; in 1899 the amount was
5,120,000 marks, and for the first six months of 1900
it was already 4,470,000 marks; 930,000 trees
making a total of 390,000 cubic metres. The sale might
probably be increased yet more without hurting the
forests.

The present condition of these Crown forests will
be better appreciated if we remember how they were
formerly treated. Over large areas of the domains
the trees have been nearly all ruined, or the woods
cut down to obtain resin or tar. Elsewhere the forests
were burnt for the sake of two years of grain and
a little subsequent pasture. Even now there is a
constant succession of forest fires, mostly due to
negligence and to lack of necessary organisation when the
fire has to be combated. In some years the fires have
been fewer, but the area destroyed in this fashion
increased again during the period 1891-95 to an
average of 40,000 acres per annum. We have already
spoken of the increase of marshes and moss in spite of
a certain amount of work already done to check them.

Theoretically the modern forest administration of
Finland is perfect. In Germany, where in some
respects the theory and practice of forestry is best
understood and carried out, there are too often lapses
from both. In some German States, especially Saxony
and parts of Southern Germany, where the principles
of men like Pressler, G. Heyer, Judeich, Von Pfeil,
Endres and others have been adopted and well executed,
we find probably the finest and best utilised forests in
the world. In Prussia principles have been laid down
contrary to simple logic, such as, for instance, the
theory that in forest business the same interest on
capital ought not to be looked for as in other industries,
and in especial that we ought not to demand ordinary
interest on the capital-value of the trees because they
grow too slowly to produce such interest. It is said,
too, that forests ought to exist for the benefit of the
public without any expectation of large profit, and
that it should be regarded as beneficial to the people
to produce large forests even if this costs more than
the woods are worth. It is unnecessary to point out
the illogical character of these so-called principles, or
the practical mistake of, for instance, the idea that the
yearly output ought to be regular even if it would
obviously pay better to fell more trees one year and
less the next. In Finland we have not noticed any such
erroneous theories. As we have already said, it was
from Tharand, the centre of sound scientific forestry,
that the first expert advisers came to Finland, and so
far as we can see the present administration fully
realises the principles of sound economy. It
understands, for example, the importance of felling
immediately the mass of old trees which do not increase
adequately every year in value, and the enormous mass
which are already too old and partly spoiled, and it
sees the necessity of studying the demands of the
market, the chances of finding purchasers, the wish
of the latter to purchase special timber from certain
regions; in general, all the market fashions. The
Finlanders do not, we believe, hold the bureaucratic
idea that they must obtain a regular yearly output;
they prefer to treat the forests in a business-like
manner. There is need of energy. It is right that
the government should hold and exploit a large forest
property instead of legislating for private owners; it
holds already a larger area than any other
government in Europe, and probably it ought to increase this
area by following the advice of the Forest Committee,
and purchasing woods on suitable soil where they can
be bought cheaply; but it ought to be able to spend
on such work more than 500,000 or 750,000 marks,
which till now has been its annual expenditure. Here
is work as important and interesting as any task in the
hands of any State in Europe; and Finland has a body
of officials sufficiently honest and capable to execute it.

Next to Finland, Russia and Sweden have the
largest forests; but only one-third of their area is
forest land, against half or even two-thirds in Finland.
The forest area in Austria is about one-third; in
Hungary it is between a quarter and a third; in Germany
a quarter; in Switzerland one-fifth; and less in all
other countries. In Sweden the situation most nearly
resembles that of Finland, but much more rapid
progress is being made there in organising the Crown
woods or areas set apart for regular forest cultivation.
These amount to 15½ million acres against the 2½
million of Finland. Only the 16 million acres of
mountain territory are not yet reserved. In Russia it
is estimated that the forests in three of the northern
provinces cover 70 per cent. of the whole country, and
in the other five northern provinces 65 per cent.
Generally speaking, all the forests in Northern Russia
are declared to be government property, as is all the
land; but notwithstanding this condition of affairs the
destruction has been much greater than in Finland.
In Northern Finland the best trees are found near the
rivers, the marsh land between the rivers being
comparatively bare of timber. This division is even more
marked in Northern Russia; near the rivers here we
find belts of land from one to seven kilometres broad
covered with firs, birch, aspen, and pines, the number
of the latter being, however, comparatively small,
while in the enormous marshes between the rivers
hardly any valuable trees are found. Everywhere,
including on the river banks, most of the sound
timber has been felled. The forest labourers, as a
rule, have been allowed to cut down trees as they
please, and it is now very difficult to procure the
timber required for commercial purposes. Over the
whole of this enormous area there are barely 25,000,000
acres of sound forest left.

During the last few years the owners of the Finnish
forests have seen their property more than double in
value. The timber merchants and owners of saw-mills
have probably experienced an even larger increase, and
the workmen have had their large share of benefit.
On the forest lands of the north they are paid
American prices for their labour; three to four marks a day,
or eight marks for a man with a horse. Foreign
business men and capitalists — Swedes, Norwegians, and
Englishmen — have taken part in this commerce,
sometimes in person, sometimes as shareholders in (mostly
Finnish) companies, also by purchasing logs to be
floated to saw-mills on the other side of the Gulf of
Bothnia. This too is to the profit of the country. It
is said that the present energetic exploitation of the
timber trade is eating up the capital of the future;
but this is a great exaggeration. In the first place, as
we have said, it is the great waste inland which causes
most of the trees to be cut down prematurely, and
this will grow less in time as the forest becomes more
valuable. In the second place, notwithstanding this
inland consumption, the annual increase of the forests,
including the Crown forests, is larger than the yearly
felling. This increase is variously estimated at from
2 to 2.4 cubic metres per hectare (2½ acres) in the
south, and from .7 to .8 cubic metres in the north.
The whole consumption may be 20½ million cubic
metres per annum, but the increase is certainly more
than 21 millions. In Sweden, where also in former
times no care was taken of the government forests,
the yearly increase is estimated at 2 cubic metres per
hectare; in Prussia, with its poor forest land, but
where much better care has been taken of the woods,
even if sound economic principles do not prevail, the
increase is 2.6 cubic metres per hectare. In any case,
in Finland both increase of growth and output of
timber might be greatly increased. The use of seed
and planting is only beginning to be understood; and
the great capacity of the country for the production
of timber is only just beginning to be utilised as it
ought. Wood of the most valuable dimensions has,
it is true, been selected for felling, and is now being
selected, but the increased means of communication,
and the growing demand for smaller sizes in timber,
are continually creating new values and new capital.
There is an enormous opening here for private as well
as public enterprise. We have been astonished to
find the seeds of such great wealth in a country which
has for so long been notorious for its poverty.
<chapter name="VI. Mining and Manufacturing Industries">
<h2><small>CHAPTER VI</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>MINING AND MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES</small></small></h2>

<sc>Finland</sc> is not rich in minerals; at any rate no
particular mineral wealth has yet been found; but although
industrial life is lagging behind agriculture and the
timber trade, there is every hope for the future, and
in some respects there is lively progress. Manufactures
closely allied to agriculture and forestry, such as
creameries, saw-mills, and pulp- and paper-mills, stand
very high; but most of the other manufactures exist
by tariff protection. It is therefore impossible to say
how far they are genuinely productive or what their
final outcome will be. Excellent conditions for the
development of certain industries exist, and we can
only hope that they may be used aright, and that the
industrial life of Finland may not be led further astray
at the expense of other business and of the great body
of consumers.

The substratum on which the later formations of
the soil are found, and which continually appears on
the surface, is granite, in its various forms as pure
granite, gneiss, porphyritic granite, &c., and is not
without industrial importance. It is an excellent
building material, frequently of beautiful colours, light
or dark grey, blue-tinted, brown, or red of the shade
of raspberries or flesh. Great masses of granite
have at different times been taken to St. Petersburg
and used for some of the most magnificent buildings
of the Imperial city. Thus it has been used for the
three rows of pillars fifty-five feet high which stand
round three sides of the Cathedral of St. Isaac, and for
the Marble Palace; and it was employed for the
monument of Alexander I., in building the quays on the
Neva and various canals, and for the ordinary
pavement of the city. Finland granite was used,
too, in the monument of Alexander II. in Moscow.
Finland stone has gone still further afield; though the
statement that the porphyry of the tomb of Napoleon
came from the coast of Lake Ladoga, or from the
beautiful porphyry in the island of Hogland in Finland,
is incorrect; it came from the Russian government
quarries in Olonetz. There ought to be a considerable
demand for this granite, since very few countries in
Europe have such fine masses as are found on the
Scandinavian peninsula and in Finland. On the great
plain of Northern Europe there is hardly any. It is,
however, a product of great weight in relation to its
value, and the transport is therefore unduly costly.
At any rate, the production in Finland is quite small,
many times less than that in Sweden, whence granite
to the value of fifteen million kronor is exported every
year. In 1898 the production in Finland was worth
only one million marks, this amount being double what
it was in 1893, when there was a slight decrease
from former years. More than half of the whole
production — paving-stones, large blocks, and polished
stones — is exported, most of it to Russia. In 1899
the export was a little less than in preceding years,
probably because building work in St. Petersburg was
less than in previous years, when money was more
abundant. In Finland itself, especially in Helsingfors,
fine building work has been done in granite, the new
Union Bank being a good specimen. On the whole,
however, the production is small compared to Scotland
and parts of the United States, where there is a
demand for fine material, whatever its cost. In the
statistics we have not included granite buildings for
agricultural purposes or those in the smaller towns.
Much is expected from the recently-formed Granite
Company of Hangö, which is introducing finished work
in granite into Finland for the first time. The granite
exported into Russia in former times came from the
neighbourhood of St. Petersburg, and the material was
finished there.

The beautiful marble, grey or tinged with blue or
green, which comes from the coast of Lake Ladoga, is
found especially at Ruskiala, where a pastor named
Alopæus discovered the quarry in the middle of the
eighteenth century. This marble has been used for
palaces and churches in St. Petersburg. Plain
limestone has been used for building from the oldest times,
as when Birger Jarl during his crusade in the middle
of the thirteenth century built the castle of Tavastehus.
The most important kind in use at present is the
burnt lime of which common mortar is made; this
was produced to the value of 700,000 marks in 1898,
as against one-third of this amount in 1893, and
two-thirds in 1891, which was a better year. The export
of limestone and mortar in 1899 was barely worth
200,000 marks. Even the most common building
materials have to pay duty when imported into Russia.
Burnt chalk is used with peat for agricultural
purposes. Cement is used in some cement foundries, but
is not made in Finland.

The manufacture of bricks and tiles rose in 1898 to
a value of 4 million marks, against 700,000 in 1893
and one million in 1895; a fact which helps to show
the activity of recent years.

In the manufacture of china and earthenware,
especially of the tiles of which the excellent tiled
stoves of Sweden and Finland are made, imported
material is used. The largest factory is the Arabia
Works of Helsingfors, where the output in 1899 was
2,200,000 marks against one million in 1893. There
is a small export to Russia of a few hundred thousand
marks’ value, hampered by an import duty of 7 marks
32 penni per 100 kilo, imposed in 1887; and even
with this the amount of importation is limited to
30,000 poods or 491 tons. We mention these
details here and elsewhere, because they are necessary in
order to understand the industrial relations of Russia
and Finland. On the other hand, the production in
Finland is protected by high duties.

The manufacture of glass has developed fast,
notwithstanding the necessity for importing the raw
material. In 1898 glass was produced to the value
of 4 million marks, against 3 millions in 1894. The
largest manufactory is that belonging to a Russian
Company with factories at Rokkala in the province
of Viborg, and Utra in Kuopio. Most of the output,
about 3 million marks’ worth in 1898, but only
2¼ millions in 1899, was exported to Russia, this
comprising about a million bottles, some window glass,
and other kinds of glass. In this case, too, the import
is hampered by a duty which was increased in 1897
to 1 mark 22 penni per kilo. As a result of this,
several kinds of exports have decreased in amount,
while others have grown.

In 1867 the Norwegian State mining expert, T. Dahll,
found gold in the affluents of the great Tana River,
which flows into the Arctic Sea and separates
Finland from Norway. Finnish experts also examined
the country, and two seamen who had washed gold in
California went up and worked on the Ivalojoki in
the Enare Lapmark. The output of gold has not,
however, attained any great importance; during recent
years its value has hardly reached 15,000 marks per
annum. Some small nuggets have been found whose
rough exterior shows that they cannot be far from the
main reef; and a piece of rock has been examined by
some experts who, for various reasons, believe that it
may contain gold. The most recent reports say that
work there has been successfully begun by a man
returned from Klondyke.

Copper ore is found in several places. Formerly it
was extracted from the Orijärvi mine in the well-known
Fiskars Works in South-West Finland. Copper has
also been found in the parish of Kuusamo in the
North-East, but not in sufficient quantities to warrant
the beginning of regular mining. At present it is
only at Pitkäranta in the South-East that the Russian
Alexandroffski Company extracts copper, which they
treat by the wet process. In 1899 they extracted
only 224 tons, of the value of 600,000 marks, together
with a very small amount of silver and tin. These
works have special permission to import into Russia
40,000 poods, or 655 tons of copper and tin.

Iron plays a not unimportant part in the history
of Finland from the oldest times, its extraction being
at first carried out in a very primitive way. Energetic
men have repeatedly taken up the work, bringing to
it the newest methods of each period. Its history
presents a picture of varying shades, not always bright,
and we must admit that even now we have great
doubts about the future of this interesting industry.
A visit of Gustavus Adolphus to Finland in 1614-16
was the occasion of renewed efforts and of a certain
amount of success. The great war with Peter the
Great destroyed everything, but when the war was
over the iron-works were re-established. In the
nineteenth century, after the separation of Finland from
Sweden, the Swedish government forbade the export
of ore to Finland, and later only permitted the
export of a limited quantity, till in 1860 a more
liberal period began and restrictions were abolished;
nevertheless, during this time a number of
blast-furnaces were established. Now that Swedish ore
can be imported freely, it is only in Eastern Finland
that it pays to use Finnish ore, this latter being
partly taken from the lakes, where it is being
deposited by nature, partly from the hills, and a little
of the less valuable kind from the morasses; such
bog-ore having formerly been used in other countries
also. In 1889 Russian firms began to extract it
from the hill country near Välimäki on Lake Ladoga,
and in 1896 at the Pitkäranta copper mines. In
1899 some 8300 tons were extracted at Välimäki,
besides 4500 tons from the moors. Most of the
ore there, which is not at first rich enough to
pay for transport, is ground and treated by a new
electro-magnetic process, whose only drawback is
that it produces dust which is poisonous to the
workmen. At Pitkäranta 10,000 tons are extracted 
yearly and treated by the wet process. The
whole mass, 24,000 tons, was formerly taken across
the lake into Russia; it is only recently that part of
the ore was treated at Pitkäranta. In 1899 some
17,000 tons of ore were imported from Sweden into
Western Finland. At Jussarö, experiments connected
with the great name of the late Baron Nordenskjöld
have been undertaken in regard to the extraction of
ore below the sea; it is an old mining enterprise
renewed, but probably will not succeed, as the ore is
not rich. In 1899 the ore from the lakes and moors
showed an output of 56,000 tons, this being less than
in some former years, and 50 per cent. less than in
1875. It contains on an average scarcely 36 per
cent. of iron, while the imported ore contains about
52 per cent.

The production of pig-iron in Finland is carried on
in fifteen blast-furnaces, eleven in Eastern and four in
Western Finland, one in the East (St. Annæ)
belonging to the Russian government, and two others to
the great Companies of Värtsilä and Varkaus. It
amounted in 1898 and 1899 to about 27,000 tons,
and is inclined to decrease; in 1897 it was 33,000
tons. The import in 1898 and 1899 was the same,
some 22,000 tons. The export to Russia in 1899
was 11,000 tons, a decrease on the 12,898 tons
exported in 1898, and 14,500 exported in 1897. In
Russia a duty is imposed on all foreign pig-iron; and
in 1897 one was placed on pig-iron coming from
Finland too, with the exception of 1½ million poods
(24,570 tons) produced from Finnish ore. If we
deduct this export we find that the internal
production consumed in the country was about 16,000 tons
per annum in 1898 and 1899. The ore, like other
raw material, does not pay any duty in Finland, but
pig-iron has to pay a duty of 1 mark 20 penni per
100 kilo. As the price is determined by the price
of the imports when these are needed to supplement
the home productions, we find here already an
increase of 10 per cent. in the value of imported raw
material, 133,000 marks for the whole amount of 1⅓
million marks.

The treatment of iron in open furnaces, known as
Franche-Comté and Lancashire furnaces, is decreasing;
in 1899 at fourteen works there was still an output
of about 3000 tons, worth one million marks. Larger
amounts are now treated by puddling; in 1899 there
were thirty iron-works belonging to six companies,
using 15,000 tons of pig-iron, which yielded 13,000
tons of mill-bars and smelted iron, this being double
the amount of 1877. Of this output 11,000 tons
were treated in nine rolling-mills and produced 9000
tons. Yet more is smelted at five iron-works in the
new Siemens-Martin furnaces; the amount of this in
1899 being 16,000 tons of pig-iron, which produced
an output of 15,000 tons against only 3000 six years
ago. Of this output 13,000 tons were rolled, but only
a small portion into plates. The total mass of iron
treated was 27,000 tons; the output of the
rolling-mills amounting in 1899 to 2½ million marks, and
of the smelting works to 3¾ million marks. Here,
too, the value is evidently fixed by the imports, which
in 1899 amounted to 13,500 tons of billets and bars
of the value of 2,300,000 marks; 7759 tons of plates
of the value of about 2½ million marks; 1600 tons of
tubes, and 632 tons of fine iron of the value of about
half a million marks. Both the bulk and the value
were a little higher in 1898. On most of this there
is an import duty of 6 marks 50 penni per 100 kilo;
and the consequent increase of price to the
detriment of the consumers, among these many of the
manufacturers, is probably not far short of 1½ million
marks, or a quarter of the whole value. Besides these
amounts, 27,000 tons of rails were imported duty-free
in 1898, and 24,000 tons in 1899. Some export of
iron goods took place into Russia, where, too, in 1885
and 1897, a duty was imposed and increased. In
1885 it was only 36 marks 60 penni per ton, after
1897 it was raised to 48 marks 75 penni per ton.
This high duty is, however, only about one-third of
that charged on imports from other countries. The
whole import of rolled and smelted iron which is
permitted to enter Russia — 6552 tons — is therefore sent
almost to the last pound.

Among the output of pig-iron we have still to
mention the work from the forges, amounting altogether
in 1899 to about 8000 tons of a value of 3 million
marks against 2700 tons in 1893, 4000 in 1890
(which was a better year), and only 1700 in 1886.
Included in this amount are various implements, such
as axes, hoes, forks, a good many horse-shoes, and not
less than 6000 tons of nails. Wire nails are an
especial feature of this industry, and the insignificant
and lessening amount of these now imported only
includes very small nails. The production is protected
by high duties, from one of 11 marks 80 penni per
100 kilo on wire nails, up to 14 marks 70 penni per
100 kilo on other kinds. There are at least five
rather large factories, three on the river Loimijoki,
one of these belonging to the Jokkis Company and
the two others to a company which also owns another
factory in the neighbouring city of Abo, and another
at Pero near Viborg. Their continued existence,
however, is probably mainly due to high protective
duties.

If we have not much confidence in the future of
this historical and still interesting industry, it is chiefly
because, notwithstanding its production of raw material
for other industries, it is protected by high duties which,
small as they are compared to those in Russia, are
still harmful and contrary to all sound economic
principles. Finland has not the best quality of iron
ore, and the time is past when wood and charcoal
were regarded as the best fuel. English coal is more
and more needed; from 1893 to 1898 the
consumption of this increased from 5000 to about
30,000 tons, and of coke from under 4000 to over
5000 tons; while charcoal has continued at about the
same figure, 300,000 cubic metres; and wood-fuel
has only doubled in amount, rising from 333,000
to 666,000 cubic metres, and being now about the
same quantity as is used to produce the charcoal. In
Western Finland especially, a large quantity of English
coal is now used, and less charcoal; and this change
will continue with the progress of trade. There is now
a great abundance of excellent and highly appreciated
iron ore in Sweden, particularly in the new mine of
Gellivara, ore which is in great demand in Germany,
England, and even in France. The ore is, however, sent
untouched to these countries, because its treatment
takes the coke of two tons of coal to one ton of ore,
even such excellent ore as the Swedish. It is not
impossible that some ore may be treated at
intermediate places on the Swedish and Danish coasts of
the Sound, because, owing to the commercial relations
between the Baltic and England, and owing to the
heavy goods transported from the Baltic, coals cost
less in freight per ton to import than the untreated
ore costs to send out. In the same way, in the United
States at least one-fifth of the excellent ore on Lake
Superior is treated at intermediate stations along the
lakes, on Lake Michigan and at towns in Ohio and
other places; only four-fifths being treated in
Pennsylvania, where the coal is found. But there is this
great drawback to a wider use of iron ore from
Grängesberg in Central Sweden, whence there is a
large import into Finland, or to a possible larger
importation from the new mines in Northern Sweden;
that the ice in the sea hinders all maritime transport
during the winter, and it would be necessary to store
large quantities of ore for a long time. As regards
the production of iron and steel in their simple forms,
we can only imagine one thing which could increase
the productions in countries like Sweden and Finland;
this would be a larger utilisation of electro-magnetism
and thereby of the plentiful water-power already used
in the treatment of other metals and in the very
small iron production at the mines of Välimäki, about
which we have already spoken. But at the present
stage of development of the iron and steel industry
we are unable to see any future for it in Finland.

In addition to 27,000 tons of rails, the iron used
in these simple forms amounted in 1898 to 44,000
tons, against 13,000 in 1893, and more than 24,000
tons in the more prosperous year of 1890, when there
was a comparatively large increase in all business. If
we translate all iron used in Finland into pig-iron, we
arrive at a total of 135,000 tons, or one
hundred-weight per head. This proportion speaks fairly well
for the modern development of the country. How
small the quantity produced and used in Finland
really is, compared with that of the great countries, is
seen when we recall the fact that the production of
iron all over the world amounts to 40 million tons a
year. The United States produce over 15 million
tons, and Germany and England about 9 millions
each.

A much more satisfactory impression is given by
what are known in Finland and Sweden as mechanical 
workshops, embracing very diverse iron industries,
including the building of iron ships and steamers. We
find greater progress here, and in most branches of
such industries an expansion which is answering
exactly to a demand, and has doubtless come to stay.
Without including the workshops on the State railways, 
forty-three manufacturing workshops of this kind,
employing 6000 men, were in active work in 1898.
The total value produced in 1899 was 25 million
marks, against 19½ millions in 1898, and 5½ millions
in 1887. In the bad years of 1893 and 1894 the
production was less than half what is now produced.
Foundries, which mostly belong to this class, have in
seven years doubled their output, which amounted
to 11,000 tons in 1899. If we add together the total
production of all mines and metallurgical industries,
we arrive at a total value for 1899 of 51¾ million
marks, against a total of 44½ million marks in
1898.

Notwithstanding this large progress, especially in
the mechanical workshops, the import of machines
and details of machinery has increased from 4 million
marks in 1889, and 6 millions in 1891 (with a lapse
to 4 millions in 1893), to the very considerable amount
of 19⅓ millions in 1898. The amount was one million
marks less in 1899, because a smaller number of
new factories were erected than in the previous year.

On some of this importation there is a slight
irrational protective duty, which in some cases has been
mitigated, though insufficiently, by a grant of free
import to machines or parts of machines for the
establishment of new factories. Even iron or steel ships of
less than 700 tons and over 400 tons, when sold into
the country, pay a duty of 2 per cent.; all wooden
steamers pay the same, and iron or steel steamers
under 400 tons as much as 4 per cent. We have
already mentioned the recent and not very high duty
on agricultural and dairy machinery. In each of the
years 1898 and 1899, some 2¾ million marks’ worth
of agricultural machines were imported, and dairy
machines to the value of upwards of ⅔ million
marks. In the case of some machines, for instance
those belonging to the pulp industry, the manufacturers 
have made such progress that they can now
export to other countries. Without the import duty
they would of course be able still further to develop
the sale of some very paying specialities. The
manufacture of locomotives at Tammerfors for the State
railways has been assisted by a considerable loan and
by some minor sums of money, in addition to the
price at which imported locomotives can be bought.
These sums are not, however, more than would
reimburse the makers for the heavy expenses caused by
the present tariff.

We see the progress of special manufactures,
especially machines and implements, when we study the
individual factories. We thereby get interesting
information about past history as well as about
possibilities for the future; but space does not permit a
complete survey, and we can only mention a few of
the largest factories. In Nyland the Machine and
Bridge-building Company of Helsingfors make a
speciality of railway bridges and steamers. The
Sandvikens Company, also of Helsingfors, owns a
magnificent dock blasted out of the rock on the sea,
and therefore well adapted for repairing ships. The
Fiskars Company in Western Nyland makes agricultural 
implements of fine iron as well as steel billets
and plates; it owns two blast-furnaces, the old Visborg
and the old copper-mine of Orijärvi, and a considerable 
amount of landed property, among which are
manors well known in history such as Gennäs, formerly
owned by the old family of Boije. The Billnäs
Company makes a speciality of spades, shovels, and similar
implements; and the Högfors factory is known for its
excellent foundry work. In Åbo-Björneborg we have
a Company established by and called after an 
Englishman, William Crichton, which builds men-of-war and
other steamers; the Åbo Iron Manufacturing Company, 
which makes railway cars, mowing-machines,
and reapers; the Dahlsbruk Company, with the largest
rolling-mill in the country, whose speciality is
ironwork for ships; the Mathildedal Company, which
makes thrashing and other agricultural machines;
and Messrs. W. Rosenlew & Co. in Björneborg, who
own a great shipyard and mechanical workshops, and
build steamers. In the province of Tavastehus we
find the Tammerfors Linen and Iron Manufacturing
Company, which, besides its textile factories for linen
goods, has large mechanical shops for locomotives,
pulp machines, &c. In the province of Viborg we
have Gallén’s mechanical workshop and shipyard, and
the Karhula engineering workshop at the eastern
mouth of the Kymmene River, whose speciality is
agricultural machines. In the province of St. Michel
are the great iron-works of Paul Wahl & Co. at
Varkaus on the Saima Lake, where a river runs down
from Iisalmi and Kallavesi between Nyslott and
Kuopio, who build steamers for the lakes of the
interior, but are connected also with saw-mills and
flour-mills; and the Oravi and Haapakoski Company, whose
speciality is iron tubes. In the province of Kuopio
there is Värtsilä on the Jänisjoki, one of the rivers
running into Lake Ladoga, with blast-furnaces, an
iron-foundry, and a rolling-mill. The same company owns
Möhkö, to which belongs the biggest unbroken area
of landed property in Finland. Strömsdal, on the
water-course which comes from Pielis in the
northeastern part of the district of Saima, has some
engineering works. Each of these works has lately
produced from 1 to 1½ million marks a year, the
larger ones 2 millions or more. Several of them
date from the seventeenth century, and have held
an important place in the early economic history of
the country; but, as is natural, have nearly all now
changed the character of their productions. Of lesser
iron-works and engineering workshops, with a chiefly
local trade, there are about fifty. At present, as we
have said, it is chiefly the manufacture of machinery
and other articles used in the country which has been
progressing, and this will undoubtedly continue to
progress.

Side by side with the great manufacturing establishments 
the work of the artisans has also made progress.
Their output has increased in value from 3 million
marks in 1893, and 4 millions in 1891 (its former
maximum) to 8½ millions in 1898. Some of their
trades are a natural result of modern progress, such as
electric work; others are in answer to a purely local
demand, and will necessarily remain manual work.
Others, again, represent antiquated forms of industry,
and are being superseded by the larger establishments.
Curiously enough, certain artisans increase in number
in bad times, the reason being that the larger works
cannot then give them anything to do.

The great water-power of the country has created
new works for the production of acetylene-light
material. The works are at Hämekoski in Ruskiala, and
at Linnakoski near Imatra, from which latter place it
is intended to conduct the power into St. Petersburg.
Already, however, like the establishments in other
countries for the production of calcium carbide, these
new establishments are finding difficulty in selling
their product. Efforts have been made to form a
joint trust with similar works in Sweden and Norway,
but one of the new works has been, it is said, obliged
to stop because of the difficulties of sale. At 
Tainionkoski, near Imatra, chloric acid kali is now
manufactured, a product which also requires considerable
power.

We have mentioned the decrease of tar manufacture,
which has now sunk in value to 1½ million marks,
greatly to the advantage of the forest. The boiling of
pitch, manufactured from tar, is an industry which is
worth mentioning, and again some new factories
established for the manufacture of other chemical products,
notably two new factories erected at Kotka and
Björneborg, connected with the unfortunate Trebertrocknung
Company of Cassel. They were intended to produce
charcoal, wood-oil, methylated spirit and acid-chalk,
but failed at the outset. The total output of the
chemical industries in 1898 was estimated at 7½
million marks.

One product of the forests, bark, and especially
willow-bark, which was once exported, is now mostly
used by the tanners of the country, who are allowed
to import all kinds of tanning materials from other
countries without duty. Half of their hides come
from the country; half are imported free of duty.
They produced in 1898 leather to the value of 14
million marks (nearly double the output of 1887),
one single factory belonging to Åström Brothers in
Uleåborg being responsible for over 3 million marks.
This factory also exported about 250,000 marks’ worth
of saddlery. Other large factories have been
established at Raumo, at Helsingfors (where the new
electric tanning method is used), and at Korkeakoski in
Orivesi. This latter is in connection with the only
shoe factory which so far has been established in
Finland, and which in the future will take a large
part in the manufacture of the two million marks’
worth of boots and shoes now made in the country.
The saddlery-houses, producing goods to the value of
1⅓ million marks, formerly exported largely to Russia,
but have now been forced to abandon this export in
consequence of the high import duty imposed by
Russia in 1897. The export of leather was worth
2¼ million marks in 1898, but this also suffers under
a duty of 18 marks 30 penni per 100 kilo imposed
in 1885.

The manufacture of soap increased between 1889
and 1898 from under 700,000 marks to double that
amount. Candles are manufactured by some houses
from imported stearine. One Russian house, the Nevski
Company, with 3 million marks capital, produces
candles to the value of about 600,000 marks a year.
Like many other Finnish industries, these live largely
by tariff protection.

Tariff protection perhaps also accounts for the fact
that the manufacture of matches has not made any
particular progress; the whole sale of the country,
worth about a million marks, is assured without
forcing the industry to any progress. Its most
important raw material, aspen-wood, abounds in the
country, and there is no import duty on the chemicals
which are at present used.

All over Finland numerous small flour-mills are
found, as is natural in a country with such abundance
of water-power. The number of these mills is
estimated at 3000; most of them do small pieces of work
for people who bring their grain to be ground and
pay in kind or “toll” — “tullkvarnar,” as the Swedes
call such mills. Large mills have recently been
established at Vasa among other places; they grind
particularly rice, having an extraordinarily high
tariff protection. The whole quantity of grain which
they grind varies naturally with the harvest and with
consequent fluctuations in the import. In 1898 the
value of their products was returned at 6 million
marks, after the bad harvest of 1897; in 1895 it
was only 1½ million; in 1893, after another bad year,
it was 4¾ million marks; in 1892 nearly 7 millions;
in 1890 again only 1½ million.

The growth of the sugar refineries is also due to a
protective tariff, and it is undoubtedly by this means
that their output for 1899 reached the large sum
of 18 million marks, against only 9⅓ million in 1889.
Nearly the whole amount is produced by two large
refineries, the Tölö at Helsingfors and the Aura at
Åbo. If we add the amount of refined sugar
imported, we have a total consumption worth about
22 million marks, double what it was a few years
ago; a good illustration of the increased wealth of
the people. Since 1897 raw sugar from Russia has
a smaller import duty, with the result that now all
sugar is bought from the Russian beet-sugar factories,
which, as our readers may know, form a kind of
trust in sugar under the direction of the Russian
Minister of Finance. This decrease in duty has
diminished the revenue of the Finnish Treasury by
several millions, but it also included a fresh increase
in the protective duties, to the advantage of the
refineries.

The bakeries produced bread to the value of
5 million marks in 1898, against 2½ millions in 1889,
another proof of better living among the people. It
is especially a consequence of a larger use of
wheat-flour, to which we shall refer later.

An exception to the general industrial progress
is furnished by the distilleries, which in 1898
produced only 6¾ million marks’ worth of brännvin or
Scandinavian whisky against 11⅓ million marks in
1886. In 1897 the value of the output amounted
to 8⅓ millions; in the poor year of 1893 to only
5 millions. In 1865 the distillation of brännvin
by anybody at home was forbidden; and an
excise duty was imposed, and later on increased
considerably to the benefit of the finances of the
country; this was with the intention of decreasing
the consumption of brännvin to a total of 11¼ million
litres or 6½ litres per head, according to the
estimate of the existing population. In fact, the quantity
consumed has decreased below this, and there is no
doubt that the duty has assisted the work of the
temperance reformers in obtaining this result. The
import of spirits from other countries is not allowed,
exemption being granted only to Cognac, rum, and
one or two other forms. Scotch and Irish whisky is
not permitted, because at the time of these exemptions
it was not known in the Finnish market. The utility
of this restriction seems to be doubtful; in Finland
there is a belief that it assists the control of alcohol,
and therefore helps the efforts on behalf of temperance.

In opposition to the use of brännvin, the more
innocuous beer-drinking has increased considerably,
and the breweries in Finland in 1898 produced
30 million litres of beer against 19 millions in 1893.
In 1882 a duty was imposed on beer in the form
of a tax on malt to the amount of 1 mark per 10
kilos. We will not here discuss the question whether
a malt tax is the most just and convenient method
of taxing beer. A decidedly wrong principle has now
been introduced into Finland in imitation of other
countries, especially of Germany, viz., a sliding scale
of duties which puts a larger tax on breweries
producing a larger amount; in Finland the larger duty
is imposed on those which use more than 50,000 kilos
of malt. It is a practice which penalises the most
progressive and economical production. Most of the
breweries in Finland are small ones. The largest
brewery, which is in Helsingfors, has now an output
worth 1⅔ million marks.

The social manners and customs of Finland and
Sweden encourage a large consumption of non-alcoholic
drinks, chiefly soda-water, with the result that factories
have been established producing comparatively large
quantities, the output in 1898 being worth about a
million marks.

The production of tobacco has also increased
considerably. The output of the factories was 10⅓ million
marks in 1898 against only 5 millions in 1889; the
largest factories being those of Strengberg in Jacobstad,
Von Rettig in Åbo, H. Borgström, junior, in Helsingfors,
and Sergeyeff in Viborg. The raw tobacco comes now
mainly from Russia, whence it pays less duty, the
amount imported from Russia being two-thirds of
the total value and a still larger proportion of the
quantity. The duty is not very high, but there is a
strong protective duty against prepared tobacco.

The progress of the printing offices is one more
demonstration of increased culture. In 1898 the
produce from these was worth 3¾ million marks against
only 2 million in 1893 and 1⅔ in 1889. If we add
to this the output of the lithographic establishments,
about one million marks in value, we arrive at a total
of about 5 million marks. Until the evil days of the
present political period Finland has also had more
than 200 newspapers, using about one million marks’
worth of paper per annum.

The most important manufacture, or at any rate that
which produces the largest values next to the
sawmills and machine factories, are the textile industries;
and chief among these are the cotton-spinning and
weaving. In 1898 these establishments produced
goods to the value of about 26 million marks, which
is a larger amount than that given in the official
statistics. Five large factories alone produced about
20½ million marks. The largest of all was established
in 1820 in Tammerfors by a Scotchman named
Finlayson, who in 1812 had been told in St. Petersburg
about the good opening which existed in Tammerfors,
his informant being a Dr. Patterson who had returned
from a visit to Finland on behalf of the Russian Bible
Society. The factory is now owned by two Russian
families, Von Nottbeck and Rauch, and the value of
its products is about 13 million marks. There is
another in Vasa producing about 5 millions, one in
Forssa producing 6 millions, another in Åbo producing
one million, and to these must now be added another
in Tammerfors and a large one in Björneborg. In
1892 the whole output did not amount to 13 millions;
in 1891 it was nearly 15 millions, and in the
prosperous year of 1889 it was only 12½ million marks,
or barely half of the present amount. In later times
about five or six million kilos of cotton have been
imported and from one to two hundred thousand
kilos of thread. This amount of cotton is now four
times as much per head as it was thirty years ago,
in 1866-68 (0.65 kilo). In 1898 the import of
finished and half-finished goods was worth 8¾
millions of marks (including cotton pieces worth over
6 millions, yarns and threads 2½ millions), against a
total of 3 millions in 1893, and 5½ millions in 1891.
In 1899 the import seems to have been less, amounting 
only to 4 million marks of piece goods and 1¾ of
yarns and threads; figures which are probably due to
a larger manufacture in the country. The amount
used in 1898 was undoubtedly of the value of about
30 million marks, and not 25½ millions as stated,
against 13½ million marks in 1893, and 18 millions
in 1891, which year was previously the high-water-mark 
of the consumption. The export figures have
remained about the same, being 2¾ million marks for
piece goods in 1898, to which must be added 1½
million marks for thread, making a total of about 4½
million marks of export in 1898. The piece goods
exported in 1899 were the value of 3 millions.
Finer goods are imported from other countries, and
cheap, glazed fabrics of bright colours from Russia.
On the other hand, there is an export to Russia of
other kinds, though it is hampered by a duty, imposed
in 1897, of from 68 marks 40 penni to 75 marks
70 penni per 100 kilos, and even with this duty the
import is not allowed of more than 50,000 pood or
about 819 tons. The export also has, in fact, been
limited to this small amount. In Finland itself, too,
the protective duties are very high, though several
times less than in Russia; they are 2 marks per kilo
on plain cotton goods. Imports into Finland from
Russia do not pay any duty whatever. In relation
to the value of the goods, the duty on goods coming
from other countries amounts generally to about
one-third of the total value.

Linen goods are manufactured by the large Linen
and Iron Manufacturing Company of Tammerfors,
which has a nominal capital of 6,200,000 marks, as
well as by two other factories which do most of their
work with thread imported from England and Germany.
Two-thirds of the flax comes from Russia. The import
is stated to be of the value of about one million marks,
nearly all of it being the simplest piece-goods,
sackcloth, and so on. As the export amounts to about
the same as the production of these factories, it seems
as if the large inland consumption is still provided by
home workers, that is by hand-weaving. Even the
very cheap imported material pays a duty of about
one-third of its value. The duty on the different
articles varies from 90 penni to 4 marks 50 penni per
kilo. Import into Russia is permitted under a lower
duty of 6 marks 10 penni per kilo, with a maximum
import of 50,000 pood or 819 tons. An article which
we may mention as one with which the Russians
cannot compete is white thread, which is used in Russia
to tie up tea-packets. Small quantities of goods are
sold to other countries, including Denmark, and some
special articles are even sent to England.

There are twenty or more woollen factories, including
some rather important establishments in Helsingfors
and Tammerfors, in and near Åbo, and even in the
country at Hyvinge. The people buy a considerable
quantity of yarn from the spinning factories to weave
at home, a method of manufacture which is antiquated
and not very profitable. The total woollen production
of the country is officially stated to be worth 7¼ million
marks; but it is, in fact, nearly 10 million, as
compared with 2⅓ million in 1893 and 3⅓ million in 1891,
previously the “record” year. The import of wool
amounts to about 2 million marks, on which, contrary
to the general rule in regard to raw material coming
into Finland, import duty is demanded. The value
of woollens imported in 1898 was about 13 million
marks, 9 million representing cloth and 3¾ million
yarn. In 1899 the yarn amounted to 4 millions, but
the cloth and other piece-goods only to 6 millions.
Of this last-mentioned import 11 million marks’ worth
comes from Russia duty free, the other 4½ millions
representing a better class of goods which Russia
cannot supply. The protective duty in this case also
amounts to about one-third of the value.

Hosiery and knitted goods are now made in several
establishments in Helsingfors and Tammerfors; in the
latter place the houses of Messrs. Dalberg & Co.
and the Klingendal Company produce goods of
considerable value. Here, too, protection is given by a
very high duty. No export of woollens to Russia on
a lower scale of duty is allowed; but the duty is lower
on a small amount of hosiery and knitted goods.

Ready-made clothes are manufactured to the value
of about four millions. The import duty is calculated
on the material, with a certain additional sum for the
work.

The Finlanders speak with some pride of these large
factories of cottons, woollens, linens, and knitted goods.
Several of the factories have now the most modern
machines from England and Germany, and some of
them give the impression of being admirably managed.
Still it is only with grave doubt that we can look at the
future of these industries, which, like many others in
Finland, rest altogether too much on tariff protection.
As long as they can increase their prices proportionately 
to the amount of the duty, they may continue to
produce goods to the profit of their shareholders or
other proprietors; but at the same time they are doing
it to the loss of the nation. At present most of these
factories pay large dividends, though not quite such
large ones as some of the factories in Russia with the
still higher duties prevailing there; but the question is
how much of this revenue is due to the protective
duties. It does not create a favourable impression to
see several of the factories at the same time take up a
variety of different articles, change their patterns, and
so on. If they were not obliged to lay themselves out
entirely for the home market in order that they may
make the highest possible profit out of the protection
accorded by the tariff, they would probably go in
much more for specialities and so obtain better general
results.

It is natural to compare the manufactures of Finland
with those of Russia. The textile, and especially the
cotton industry, is the most important of all
manufactures in Russia, and really benefits by several
natural advantages; it is close to markets in which
there is a large genuine demand and which use a
considerable amount of cheap cotton goods; and wages
are much lower than in England or in America,
or even in that part of Germany where weaving and
spinning have their particular home. Nevertheless it
is certain that the great majority of Russian factories
would be closed on the day when they could no longer
live by high protective duties at the expense of the
consumer. There is, however, one exception to the
general rule in Russia, not less interesting because,
more than any other factory in Russia, this one works
under conditions very like those in Finland. Von
Schultze-Gävernitz, a German author who has
examined into the industrial situation of Russia with the
greatest care and technical knowledge, exempts this
establishment from his general opinion of Russian
factories. It was erected at Kränholm, at a fall of the
river Narva, by the man who introduced and for a long
time dominated the cotton industry of Russia, the
Anglicised German Von Knoop. It has this advantage 
over the factories in the interior of Russia, that it is
near coal, cotton, imported machinery, and other
manufacturing material which are of importance; although
here, as elsewhere in Russia, high duties must be paid on
raw material and other articles used. But then, most 
important matter of all, it has workmen of a race entirely
different from the Russians, the latter being unreliable,
demanding much supervision, making continual
mistakes which use up material, and, finally, seldom
furnishing first-class work. Von Schultze-Gävernitz calls
these other workmen Esthonians, who belong to the
same race as the inhabitants of half Finland; it is
more likely, however, that the workmen are
inhabitants of Ingermanland; but these too have been
and still largely are true Finns. In this factory
one man can supervise 20,000 bobbins; and it is only
here that the finest thread (No. 90 S.) can be made;
Egyptian cotton and combing machines are used.
Where piece goods are made, one weaver takes charge
of two or three looms, and one man can supervise
fifty workmen. The result is that one workman here
produces goods annually of the value of 402 roubles,
against only 146 in Moscow and 141 in Vladimir.
What is said about the workmen in this particular
Russian factory undoubtedly holds good about the
workmen in Finland. The Finns are inferior to
Englishmen; their hands are less good; they make
more mistakes. It takes time, of course, to train
country workmen. But English superintendents allege
that they will be able to bring the Finnish workmen
to as high a condition of skill as their English
companions. Even if the result is less productive than the
English labour, it will probably be at least as cheap; the
pay, if high according to Finnish standards, will be lower
than the English. The average wage in Finland for
the spinners and weavers in cotton factories is 637
marks, against 423 for the spinners and 467 for the
weavers in Russia; for the weavers of woollens 521
marks in Finland against 466 in Russia; for
the spinners of flax 480 marks in Finland against
332 in Russia. Notwithstanding this, work is cheaper
for the masters in Finland, in spite of the low wages in
Russia. At present Finnish work is estimated to cost
rather more than English, but it will undoubtedly be
cheaper when the hands are better instructed.

The town of Tammerfors, where most of the above
and many other kinds of manufactures are established,
and which is therefore called by the Finns the
Manchester of their country, is at present in possession
of the valuable privilege of importing all material used
by the factories, including thread for the weavers, free
of duty. Alexander I. granted this privilege to the
town on his visit to Finland in 1819, and it was
renewed by Alexander II. in 1856 for fifty years, <i>i.e.</i> till
1906. The liberty is excellent, but it ought to be
extended to the import of such articles into the whole
of Finland.

It is with unmixed satisfaction that we can review
those great industries which are connected with the
principal trades of the country — <i>i.e.</i> the creameries,
saw-mills, and the manufactories of pulp, pasteboard
and paper, which also produce the greater part of the
values exported from Finland. In speaking about the
forests, we mentioned the wealth which has lately
come from them, especially through the saw-mills.
As a result of the greater liberty granted since 1857
— steam-power being now allowed, and the mills being
no longer restricted to certain districts and certain
quantities of wood, and since 1885 no longer needing any
special concession for the introduction of steam into the
work — a great number of saw-mills, some 500 in all,
have been erected, and among these are now a number
of very large mills, producing annually work worth
millions of marks. More than half of these mills,
especially the large ones, use steam instead of 
water-power; because it is important that they should be
situated where a large quantity of wood can be collected
for export instead of being tied to places near
waterfalls. This is the reason why the larger works are
located at the mouth of rivers coming from the great
systems of lakes. Thus at Björneborg, on the southern
coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, at the mouth of the
Kumo River, which runs down from the lake systems
of Näsijärvi and Pyhäjärvi, the Räfsö Steam Sawmill
Company has its works, and Messrs. W. Rosenlew and
Co. and Messrs. Ahlström have very large mills. On
the coast of the Gulf of Finland, at the mouth of the
Kymmene, which runs down from the lake system of
Päijänne, in the town of Kotka, a town which has been
created during the last thirty years, large firms such
as Paul Wahl & Co., Messrs. Ahlqvist, the Norwegian
firm of Gutzeit, the Halla Company, Messrs. W. Ruuth
and others, own saw-mills which are producing millions
of marks yearly. On the lake system of Saima, the
biggest system of all, whose extent is continually being
increased by the making of canals, it has been found
profitable to build the largest mills in the interior on
the lakes, where in especial Messrs. Hackmann & Co.,
and Messrs. Paul Wahl & Co., of Viborg, have large
factories. Big mills are also found at the mouth of
the smaller rivers in Southern and South-Western
Finland, in which part of the country Herr August Eklöf,
of Borgå, is the greatest exporter. Finally, some of
the largest mills are located in the far north at Kemi,
where a company has a capital of 5 million marks,
at Uleåborg, and elsewhere. At present wood is being
sawn and transported <i>viâ</i> the White Sea, where trunks
and logs are now floated out from part of the Crown
domains.

Some saw-mills are at the same time planing-mills,

and it is reckoned that by this arrangement, which
reduces the bulk by one-sixth, one-sixth of the cost of
export is saved. Planing-mills in Finland, however,
play a much less important part than those in Norway.
Joinery and cabinet-making has made progress,
producing a value of 3½ million marks, against 1½ million
in 1893. Some of the factories are of considerable
size, as for instance those of Sandviken and Sörnäs in
Helsingfors, Boman in Åbo, which produces some very
fine articles, and a house in Borgå which produces
even more artistic goods. Such goods, however, were
imported to the value of about a million marks in
1898, and very little was exported. We will not
discuss the influence on this industry of strong tariff
protection, which naturally leads it to work especially
for the home market. A large export can only be
created by producing large quantities of the same
goods. Big cities like Hamburg, of course, have a
great advantage, being centres of the commerce of the
world, whence goods can accordingly be distributed in
large and small quantities according to the demand.

Bobbins for the large spinning factories of England
and other parts of Western Europe are now partly
produced in Finland, the value being about 2 million
marks. The factories are large, and located in the
interior, where an abundance of birch is found, two
factories being owned by the Tornator Company at
Lahtis in Tavastland, and at Tainionkeski, near Imatra;
another by Colonel Standertskjöld, near Villmanstrand;
and there are several others.

The largest and most successful industry next to
the saw-mills and creameries is undoubtedly the
manufacture of pulp and paper, which at once uses the chief
raw material of the country, the timber, and at the
same time utilises a part of the enormous water-power
which is otherwise little used. Altogether the
waterfalls of Finland now actually being used are estimated
to represent about 50,000 horse-power, and this
industry alone uses about 30,000. Whenever we
find one of these forty factories, we find a place with its
name ending in “koski,” the Finnish for waterfall. In
addition to supplying the inland demand, the factories
export goods to the value of between 17 and 18
million marks, the sum in 1899 being 18 millions.
The pulp factories, of which the first large one was
erected in 1865, and of which there are now twenty-five 
in operation, are stated to produce 51,000 tons
of pulp, of the value of about 6 million marks; in
reality they produce much more, but no accurate
information is obtainable as to what is used in the
country. Two-fifths of the output is exported, half in
dry and half in wet pulp, and the latter export in
particular is increasing. Of the more valuable
cellulose, of which there are eight factories in operation,
about 14,000 tons were produced in 1898, the value
being 4 million marks, of which 2⅓ million marks’
worth was exported. At the same time the paper
factories continue to import cellulose. Of pasteboard
about 31,000 tons is produced, of the value of
4 millions, included in this being felt for roof-work,
and especially asphalt felt. The greater part of the
export consists of paper and pasteboard, among which
the more valuable kinds of writing paper and
cigarette paper have been of late considerably
increasing in value. Cardboard and the cheaper kinds
of paper have been increasing more in quantity
than in value. Paper is made in fourteen factories,
the export being 32,000 tons, of the value of over
14 million marks. Notwithstanding the import duty
in Russia, the imposition of which caused the 
manufacturers at once to look out for new foreign markets,
Russia continues to be the best market, though
considerable quantities are exported to England and
Germany, some to Denmark, Holland, and France, and
a little even to Brazil and Japan. Paper to the value
of 1½ million marks is imported. This large development 
in the trades connected with pulp and cellulose
has taken place entirely during the last two decades.

Among the older-established paper-mills is the
factory formerly belonging to Messrs. J. C. Frenckell
and Sons in Tammerfors, with very varied goods, and
where rags, straw, pulp and cellulose are all used;
and the Tervakoski factory in Southern Tavastland,
belonging to a company under the management of
A. F. Wasenius, a mill which uses only rags and
produces the finest kind of paper, which has been well
represented at the various Paris Exhibitions. The
first large pulp factory was established by F. Idestam
in Tammerfors in 1865 and later at the Falls of
Nokia in the same neighbourhood. The latter place
is well known in older Finnish history, as it is
to-day, for its beautiful situation on the Kumo River,
where it runs out of the Pyhäjärvi, or “Holy Lake,”
bringing a mass of water from the Näsijärvi lake system.
This company now produces cellulose also, as well as
all kinds of paper. Among other mills which make
partly pulp or cellulose and partly paper may be
mentioned the Mänttä factory, north of Tammerfors,
established by the late G. A. Serlachius; the Valkiakoski
factory, east of Tammerfors; the Ingerois factory at
the Anjala Falls on the Kymmene River, belonging
to the Tammerfors Linen and Iron Manufacturing
Company; two great factories belonging to the
Kuusankoski and Kymmene Companies at the
Kuusankoski Falls in Kymmene; the great new
Voikka Works on the same river, established by Herr
R. Elving; and the mill of the Kangas Company at
Jyväskylä in the interior on the Pyhäjärvi lake system.
There are also the mills of Herr L. Hammarèn at
Kyrökoski in Southern Ostrobothnia, and the mill of
Äännekoski north of Jyväskylä; the cellulose factory
of H. Standertskjöld at Villmanstrand; the large
pulp mill of the Enso Company on the Vuoksi River;
and the paper factory of the above-mentioned
Tornator Company at Tainionkoski near Imatra, under
the direction of Eugen Wolff in Viborg. Each of
these mills produces from one to two million marks
a year. They have been erected at different periods,
but especially in those periods of expansion in which
the industries of other countries, too, have made
especial progress. Much is heard in regard to this
industry about the abuse of cutting down small sizes
of wood. To a great extent, however, their cutting
down is decidedly profitable, and it is a necessity in
any scientific forest cultivation.

The total progress of these manufactures which,
as will be seen by the preceding remarks, differ
greatly in their national importance, may be summed
up in the following figures. In 1887 the total
output was estimated at 114 million marks; in 1891
at 170 millions; then less during the following bad
years, the lowest being 159 millions in 1893. It
increased again in 1894 to 170 millions, and rose
to 284 millions in 1898, and to at least 300 millions
in 1899. The number of workmen engaged in
it is estimated at about 100,000, or about 4 per
cent. of the total population in the country. On
an average each workman produces 3115 marks
against 2136 in 1887. The manufactories are mainly
found in the south-west, especially in Helsingfors;
others are in Tammerfors and Åbo; others in Viborg,
Vasa, Björneborg, Uleåborg, Kotka, and Jakobstad,
after which come the other towns on the coast.
The small towns have not progressed as much as the
larger, as usually happens in these days. Considerable 
influence was exercised in former days by the
guilds or corporations, which were finally abolished
in 1879, and which, together with town privileges,
gave to certain small towns an artificial advantage at
the expense of other localities. In 1887 each business
had on an average eight workmen and an output
of 20,000 marks per annum; and in 1898 this
average was twelve workmen and 36,000 marks. In
1843 most of the work was done by hand; there
being ninety factories with 8500 artisans, 6000
hired workmen, and an output not much exceeding
2 million marks; while most of the master-craftsmen,
notwithstanding the town privileges, lived in the
country. Now only a small part of the manufacture
is produced by artisans, the amount in 1897 being
31 million marks, which came from four thousand
shops with 13,800 workmen.

With regard to the wages of Finnish workmen
we have already quoted the averages in the textile
industry. They vary considerably; for one reason,
because piece-work is much in vogue. This is the
case even with women and children; as an example
of whose wages we may quote the women in the linen
mills at Tammerfors, who receive 2 marks, the boys
receiving 1 mark 50 penni, older boys 1.90 and
small girls 1.40. Wages in the textile mills here, as
usual, are not the highest, because the work makes less
demand on the strength of the workers and is not
always very trying. In the paper-mills, where the case
is the same, the average wage is stated to be 612 marks,
to which must be added house-rent and firewood. In
the earthenware and china works an average of 666
and 1442 marks is paid, and at glass factories 949.
At the saw-mills the wages are higher, being 849
marks besides house-rent and firewood. At the iron
and engineering works comparatively high wages
prevail, the average being 895 at the former and
1087 at the latter, the high wages in the engineering
trade being due to the rapid progress which this
industry is making. In another chapter we have
mentioned agricultural wages, and pointed out that
even when we include in our calculation the larger
property holders and peasant proprietors, the average
income of a family in the country does not amount
to more than 786 marks a year. The above-mentioned 
wages in the manufacturing trades, which it
must be remembered are the wages of individuals,
not of families, are therefore very favourable when
compared to the incomes of the agricultural classes.
The impression made on us by the appearance of
the factory hands in Finland, compared with that
made by country folk, is equally favourable. The
Finnish workmen have their faults; they are, for
instance, hardly as quick as those of the Western
countries; but they excel in other directions. They
stick more closely, for instance, to hard work.
Generally they are superior to the Russians, but
these latter are better at certain kinds of work in
the open air; for instance men from the province of
Jaroslav excel at all paving work; Russians are also
good gardeners. In some factories we have met men
who have been in the United States, and who are
clever at introducing new methods of work.

Women are employed in considerable numbers in
certain industries; in the textile mills, for instance,
where two-thirds of the workers are women, and in
still larger numbers in the tobacco factories. The
progress of the textile industry would have been
impossible without women.

The law of 1889 with regard to child labour states
that children between twelve and fifteen may work
for seven hours a day, with half-an-hour’s rest for
meals, or 8½ hours when they have completed their
course at school. Children between fifteen and eighteen
may work for fourteen hours a day with two hours’
rest for meals. No children may work at night. At
first after the passing of this law their number decreased,
but the factories soon accommodated themselves to the
new regulations, and now children are employed in
even larger numbers than before, the girls especially
in weaving, the boys in glass factories.

A law of 1895, which came into operation in 1898,
compels a master to pay a workman who has been
incapacitated by accident, three-fifths of his wages
after the seventh day of the accident; and the master
must insure his workman for the same amount in case
of his being incapacitated for a longer time or for
life. In case of death, certain amounts are also paid
to the widow, and to children up to the age of fifteen
years.

Much good work is done by associations formed by
workmen themselves, as well as by private efforts
made by the masters on behalf of their men. In
Tammerfors, for instance, we have seen excellent
establishments, with libraries and well-arranged kitchens,
where the workmen meet and listen to music and
otherwise entertain themselves. Private schools of
various kinds have been established, and the
government also has organised schools, not only an ordinary
polytechnic institution for the heads and managers of
departments, but schools for men lower down in the
industrial scale. Socialistic movements are not
unknown, but do not exercise any great influence; and
large strikes are not numerous.

The Finlanders take a great interest in home
occupations, and schools have been established everywhere
to teach such employments, in which much zeal and
skill is often developed. The State frequently,
contributes to them, giving for instance 300,000 marks
in 1883. The Societies of Rural Economy and others
have also contributed to these schools, which teach
weaving and the manufacture of common implements.
Many articles are manufactured all over the country,
and certain parishes frequently have their specialities;
as, for instance, the rocking-chairs, spinning-wheels,
and thrashing-machines which are made in certain
localities of Ostrobothnia and Tavastehus, and the
simple waggons which are made in the province of
Viborg and frequently sold in St. Petersburg. This
domestic industry must not be confused with the
home work which is carried on in large parts of
Russia, which constitutes the whole livelihood of the
people there, and does not therefore answer to the
requirements of modern civilisation, inasmuch as it
necessarily creates poverty. In Finland as a rule
these home occupations are not carried on for the
supply of family needs; but even here the form of
work is not very profitable in these days of cheap
factory production. We have noticed, for instance,
weaving-schools teaching hand-work such as is done
in the factories by machines, a decidedly unproductive
employment. Much of this household industry is also
very antiquated; and it is a poor argument in favour
of it that the people have nothing better with which
to employ their time.

Among the more important conditions of industrial
development, personal capacity is always the most
important. We have spoken of the workmen, of their
progress, capacity, and wages. Just as important are
the personal qualities found in the heads of the
different industries. One reason for our belief in the
industrial future of Finland is that the same men are
able to manage business of varying kinds; the same
names reappear as heads of different departments.
This fact leads us to believe that they are as well able
to develop industries which belong naturally to the
country as those which merely live by artificial tariff
protection.

It is not without reason that the wealth of the
waterfalls is spoken of. In 1889 the chief of the
Department of Communication, the late Baron G.
Alfthan, ordered an examination of the waterfalls;
but although this examination has not been extended
to the rivers running out into the Polar Sea and the
White Sea, nor to the northern portion of the rivers
running down to the Gulf of Bothnia, 700 falls with
above two million horse-power have been measured.
It is true that the utility of the falls in the
northernmost part of the country is less because of the ice at
the bottom during the greater part of the year, and of
other impediments; and in a great number of other
rivers the power of the falls is dissipated in rapids
instead of forming concentrated water-power. This is
in consequence of the somewhat low elevation of the
country. Among the large lake systems, however, the
lakes not only form reservoirs securing a regular supply
of water, but the large body of water coming out from
these lakes creates everywhere a sufficiently
concentrated force. Large falls are found in the northern
rivers running out into the Gulf of Bothnia, but in
these particularly the water-power is spread over such
a long distance of rapids that the force which it is
possible to use decreases to a very small quantity.
The most northerly river, the Muonio, has a fall of not
less than 72,000 horse-power. Torneå has nine falls
of more than 30,000 horse-power each, one of 116,000,
and another of 133,000. The river Kemi, or Kemijoki,
has three falls of more than 50,000 horse-power each.
These rivers respectively receive the water of 34,000
and 53,000 square kilometres of land; and the snow
on the mountains, which melts late, furnishes a
continuous body of water. Iijoki with its affluents has
eighty falls; and, on its own water alone, one of 123,000
horse-power, and nine others varying from 11,000 to
55,000 horse-power. The Kajana and Emäjoki, affluents 
of the Uleå or Oulunjoki, have seven falls of 10,000
to 27,000 horse-power. After the Uleå has flowed
out of its large lake it has one fall, the Niskakoski,
of 158,000 horse-power (one of the instances of great
reduction for practical application, for it can only be
reckoned at 27,000 horse-power), and another, the
Pyhäkoski or “Holy Fall” of not less than 222,000
horsepower. Few of the rivers farther down the coast have
very large reservoirs, with the exception, however, of
the Lojo River in the south-west and the lake-system
of Jänisjärvi in the south-east, from which come the
rivers which we mentioned when speaking of the
industrial establishments. A couple of large falls, also
previously mentioned, are found on the river Kumo
where it runs out from the lake-system of Näsijärvi
and Pyhäjärvi; and we have referred to several others
on the rivers which carry water down from the north
to this system of lakes. More considerable, and also
already noticed, are the four falls at the mouths of the
Kymmene River, which carries down the water from
the Päijänne and Puulavesi lake-systems; these have
a horse-power varying from 24,000 to 38,000. Still
larger are those of the Vuoksi, which has four falls of
31-33,000 horse-power, two of 44,000 and 48,000,
one of 52,000, and finally the Imatra fall of 117,000
horse-power. In this part of Finland, on the Vuoksi
and other rivers which flow into the Lake Ladoga, it is
believed by many that the wealth of water-power is
going to create a particularly rich industrial future.
One advantage is that electricity now makes it possible
to carry the power to a considerable distance; and
also the electricity which is created by these falls can
now be directly applied in metallurgy as in other
industries. Certainly the plant costs more with
water-power than with steam. Furthermore, it is useless to
undertake such new enterprises until certain other
conditions have come into existence; among which a
market for the resulting output is not the least
important. Calcium of carbide, for which there was
supposed to be an unlimited demand, is said to be
one of the last instances of this difficulty.

Like most other countries in past centuries Finland
had an abundance of monopolies, including even such
a popular industrial material as tar, of which a
company had the monopoly. There were also privileges
for the towns. In the latter part of the eighteenth
century some considerable men came to the front —
Chydenius, who was in advance of Adam Smith, and
others who might be compared with, and were in
some degree connected with, the French physiocrats,
especially with the more liberal parts of their doctrine.
To-day the Finnish government, acting on the principles 
of modern liberalism, has lent very considerable
assistance to the industrial development of the age,
and in particular has done great service by permitting
complete industrial liberty. We have referred to the
gradual abolition since 1857 of restrictions on the
saw-mills. Not long afterwards it was declared
permissible for everybody to enter into commercial and
industrial business if he merely reported himself to the
authorities, and either paid a tax in the town or, if he
were in the country, paid a certain fee for a licence.
Finally, in 1879, complete industrial liberty was
granted by the abolition of the old guilds or close
corporations, and of the privileges of the towns.
Practically there is no hindrance to the formation
of joint-stock companies. Only Finlanders, however,
can be directors. While in Russia it takes a year
to get through the formalities of formation, and costs
generally more than 1000 marks, it costs in Finland
six marks, and is done in a week, or at the utmost
in one month’s time. The worst remaining hindrance
is the protective tariff. In this matter little progress
and even some retrogression has taken place. This
is in consequence of the peculiar arrangement by
which, according to the old Swedish constitution,
tariff-regulation does not come within the powers of
the Diet. There is no doubt but that this protective
tariff imposes on the people a tax of many million
marks a year, and of more than the taxes paid by the
same articles to the Treasury. It would be interesting
and not impossible to calculate how much of the
increased price of various goods is due to this tariff
protection, which is the worst possible system under
which manufactures can develop.

The extension of the field of protective duties is
often a means of producing greater liberty. The
amalgamation of the Finnish tariff with the Russian,
to which we shall have to come back, would be a step
in the opposite direction, and an enormous diminution
in existing industrial liberty. The Russian tariff
imposes a high duty on the principal as well as on the
accessory materials of manufactures, on coal, iron,
machinery, cotton, and on all the chief necessities of
life. The duty is generally three or four times as
high as the duty in Finland, and often even more. It
is twice as high on iron and steel billets, more than
twice as high on iron plates, forged iron, nails, and
machines; ten times as high on wool, and three to
four times as high on cotton yarn. The duty on iron
ore would increase the price of pig-iron by not less
than 35 marks (or 24 per cent.) per ton, and of steel
billets, for the manufacture of which 1.32 tons of raw
iron is needed, by at least 50 marks, without
reckoning any profit, if their production in the country was
continued; otherwise, if imported, by 80 marks per
ton. The hides and the tanning material of the great
tanneries would cost considerably more. Even the
cotton manufacturers, judged by their present output,
would have to pay 3½ million marks more duty on
cotton and half a million more in duty on other
imported material which they use. The introduction of
these tariff duties into Finland would cripple many
of the best manufactures of the country, especially its
agriculture and forest industry. This evil influence is
apparent enough in Russia, where it contributes greatly
to the impoverishment of the farmers, and results in a
final loss also to the manufacturers, who have to sell
to the people and even to the government, which is
obliged to look to the principal industry of the country
for its main revenue. It might benefit particular
businesses, such as the factories of pulp, cellulose, and
paper, as well as the iron-works in the east, which
would find a larger market in Russia. Possibly also
more waterfalls would be utilised and divers new
factories erected. But it would be bad business, and
result in a loss for the nation, not to mention the fact
that it would in several ways create a difficulty in the
present economical organisation of Russia itself. It
would not be the Finlanders themselves, but rather,
as in Russia, foreign capitalists, who would establish
the new industries and make money at the expense of
the people. The manufacturers themselves would for
the most part be of the same character as at present
in Russia, where so many mines and factories live at
the expense of the people, and their owners often
benefit enormously. But every such factory is
obliged to close on the day when reason resumes its
sway and liberty enters. The present progress in
Finland, which is closely connected with the progress
of international commerce, would be destroyed; the
whole industrial life of the country would suffer;
civilisation would receive an enormous set back.

<h2><small><small>COMMERCE, NAVIGATION, AND FISHERIES</small></small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> rapid progress of Finland’s commerce, one of the
proofs of the country’s development, is of recent date.
The old Custom House statistics are of little value
because of the corruption of the officials, and the large
amount of smuggling due to the high Customs tariff
and other causes. Nevertheless, in 1836, when
the situation of the country was already greatly
improved, the whole foreign trade amounted only
to 18 million marks, about equally divided between
imports and exports. In 1846 it was 31 millions;
of which the exports were only represented by the
same amount as in 1836, 9 million marks, and the
balance of 22 millions was import trade. In 1841
it had increased to 44 millions, of which 26 millions
represented export and 18 import; but in 1851 the
total was only 37 million marks, of which 10 millions
represented export and 27 import; while the average
for all foreign trade during this period was only
32 millions. In 1866 the figures increased, showing
a total of 76 millions, of which 28 millions were
export and 48 import. In 1875 it went up to 243
millions, 85 millions export and 158 import, and in
1876 decreased again to 230 millions, 90 being export
and 140 import. In 1886 the total had decreased to
176 millions, of which only 99 represented import.
But from that time foreign trade increased rapidly, to
a total of 203 millions in 1888; 236 millions in 1889;
only 233 millions in 1890, though with a balance of
48 millions in favour of imports; and again only 239
and 241 millions in the unfavourable years of 1892
and 1893, with a balance of imports, however, of 52
in 1892 and in 1893. In 1894 the total was
again 274 million marks, with scarcely 3 millions
excess of imports, it being now Finland’s turn to
liquidate its debt to foreign countries. In 1895 the
total had increased to 293 millions, with a balance of
hardly 7½ millions of imports; and in 1896 to 332
millions, with 14 millions excess of imports. And then
in the following years came a large increase with an
especially large excess of imports; 371 millions in
1897 with a balance of 34 millions of imports; 417
millions in 1898 with 57 millions excess of imports;
436 millions in 1899 with 66 millions excess of
imports. This last year’s total shows an increase of
only 24 millions on the preceding year, instead of 40
millions increase as shown in the two preceding years.
In 1900 the total was 468 millions, with the
considerable excess in imports of 73 millions owing to
special reasons. During the last ten years there has
been a doubling of the whole trade, and Finland has
thus come to possess a foreign trade which is
large relatively to the number of its inhabitants. The
average for this trade in Finland is 165 marks per
head of the population; 66 marks per head being the
average for all countries. In Russia it is only 25
marks. But the Finnish average is less than the
neighbouring Scandinavian countries; Sweden having
had a foreign commerce in 1898 averaging 220 marks
per head, Norway 308, and Denmark 575 marks per
head.

It is interesting to examine the character of this
commerce. As regards the export we have already
called attention to the most important article, timber,
the export of which had increased in value in
1900 to 114 million marks, against 101 millions in
1899, 94 millions in 1898, 82 in 1897, and 71½
millions in 1896. In 1899 planks, deals, and battens
together produced 7 million marks more than in 1898,
planks and deals producing 16 millions against 12 in
1898, and battens 32 millions against 29. Boards
produced 31 million marks against 33 millions in
1898. It is only in a slight degree that the increase
of the past few years is due to the increased prices
obtained. In 1876 the total export of wood
was 50 millions, against 12½ millions in 1866, less
than 5 millions in 1856, less than 4 millions in
1846, and only a little more than 2 millions in
1836; so recent is the development of this wealth.
We have referred to pulp, cellulose, and paper, the
value of which in 1899 was not much less than
18 million marks. In 1876 it was only 3½
millions, in addition to 1¾ million marks’ worth of
wall-paper; at that time, before tariff alterations, a great
article of export to Russia. We have referred also
to the diminution in the manufacture of tar; and now
willow-bark, too, which produced 1½ million marks in
1876, has ceased to be exported to any great extent,
most of it being used in the country. Cattle are
exported somewhat less: only in special years have oats
showed a considerable export value; fish produced about
3 million marks in 1899, but this was no increase on
former amounts. In addition to wood, including pulp
and paper, it is now, as we have said, butter which is
the largest contribution of agricultural industry to the
export trade, and which produces the largest amount.
In 1897 this sum was 30 million marks for about
14,500 tons; a steady increase from the 7000 tons of
the period 1889-91. The small export overland to
St. Petersburg is not included in this figure. The
total export in 1884 was only 4000 tons, 4500 tons in
1868, and only 500 tons in 1852 and 1856, the first
and last years of the Crimean War. In 1894 it was
13,300 tons, the value being 24⅓ million marks. We
have already mentioned how, in spite of a larger
production, the amount of the export decreased in 1898
to 12,500 tons and 27 million marks, and in 1899
10,000 tons and 23½ million marks, on account of the
increasing wealth of the people and a larger home
consumption. Also the contribution of Finnish manufactures 
to a larger general export has been mentioned,
as well as their less favourable points, and in particular
their connection with the Russian import tariff. In
addition to the goods mentioned, the tariff also
favoured hides, which were exported to the value of
4 million marks (3 million of which was for tanned
hides); cotton and linen in piece-goods to the value
of 6 millions; yam and thread 2½ millions; metals
and machinery 5 millions; and finally stone and stone
articles to the value of 4 million marks. The export
of ships ought to be especially mentioned; in 1899
it had risen to a value of 5½ million marks, of which
the export to Russia, mainly steamers, was worth
4¾ millions. The whole body of exports, however,
depends and will continue to depend on the progress
of forest exploitation and agriculture.

Notwithstanding the increased production of grain,
this and flour are the two articles of the import which
have increased most, and it is evident that this large
increase is by no means due to isolated bad harvests.
In 1899 the import reached 291,000 tons of the
value of 59 million marks, against 194,000 tons and
44 million marks in 1898; 200,000 tons and 41
million marks in 1897; 190,000 tons and 29 million
marks in 1896, and for instance 85,000 tons and 15
million marks in 1888, 69,000 tons and 13 million
marks in 1887; and 77,000 tons and 21 million
marks in 1886. Rye and rye-flour have especially
increased; rye to 78,000 tons and 11 million marks
in 1899, against only 37,000 tons in 1898, 30,000
tons in 1897, and between 20,000 and 21,000 tons in
1895 and 1896; rye-flour to 145,000 tons and 23
million marks in 1899, against only 95,000 tons in
1898, and about the same amount in former years.
The amount of imported rye has in latter years been
four times as much per head as thirty years ago, in
1866—68 (3.79 kilos per head). The import of wheaten-flour 
has increased considerably, and the increase has
continued into the year 1900, the amount per head
now being five times as much as in 1866—68, when
it was only 3.56 kilos. Even oats, which a few years
ago, in 1896, could be exported to the value of 7
million marks, are at present imported in considerable
quantities — a proof that the cattle are being better
fed. Maize was imported to the extent of about
10,000 tons, and the value of about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> million marks,
notwithstanding the duty on its import from any
other country than Russia; against 8000 tons in
1898, 4000 tons in the two former years, and only
1500 tons in 1891. In 1899 about 9½ million
marks’ worth of animal produce was imported,
against less than 7 millions in 1898, less than 5½
in 1897, and 4½ millions in 1896. The import of
meat and pork, partly American — notwithstanding the
prohibition to import American pork without special
permission — was of the value of over 7 million marks
in 1899, against less than 5 millions in 1898, and
less than 4 millions in 1897. The import of
meat and pork was already in 1898 1.28 kilo per
head, as against .06 in 1866-68. The import of
eggs in 1899 was 25 millions, and the value 1¼ million
marks; in 1898 19 million eggs were imported, and
in 1897, 18 millions. The import of apples in 1899
was of the value of 1⅓ million marks; but there was
a larger import of other fruits. We have spoken too
about the greatly increased consumption of sugar, of
which 27,000 tons were used in 1899, against 25,000
in 1898, 21,000 in 1897, 18,000 in 1896, and 16,000
tons or less in 1895 and 1894; the weight being
reckoned in refined sugar. In 1886 the amount
imported was under 10,000 tons of the value of
about 5 million marks; but in early years, for
purposes of comparison, one million marks should be
added for the confectionery which up to 1896 was
imported from Russia, but which is now manufactured
in the country as a result of the duty which has been
imposed. The import of sugar was in 1898 9.43 kilos
per head, or nearly five times as much as thirty years
ago (2.04). Coffee was imported in 1898 to the
amount of 8,400 tons; in 1899 to the amount of 8,100
tons, against only 6,000 tons in the period 1894-96,
and 5,000 tons in 1893. The value in 1896 was more
than 13 million marks, a figure due to exceptionally
high prices, and 5½ million marks in 1886. The
import in 1898 represents a consumption of 3.20 kilos
per head, or three times as much as in 1866-68
(1.11). Tobacco increased, as already mentioned, to
4 million marks in 1899, against 2 millions in 1886.
If we also here compare the figures of 1898 with
those of thirty years earlier, the period of 1866-68,
we find an increase in consumption of from 0.42
to 5.74. Petroleum rose to 19,500 tons with a
value of 2¾ million marks in 1899, against 17,500
tons in 1898, 16,400 tons in 1897, 15,000 in 1896,
13,000 in 1895, 7,000 in 1888, and not much
over 5,000 tons in 1886. In 1898 it was 6.63
kilos per head against 0.8 thirty years earlier. All
these figures tell an eloquent tale of the progress
and well-being of the people. Equally worth
mentioning is the import of fodder, which in 1899 included
30,000 tons of wheat-bran, 3,000 of rye-bran, and
5,000 of oil-cake, with a total value of 4 million
marks. Like the import of maize, this import of
fodder is trifling compared to other countries, Denmark,
for instance; but it is a new and noteworthy item in
the Finnish imports. Phosphates increased to about
14,500 tons in 1899, against less than 11,000 in
1898, and 7,750 tons in 1897. The import of coal
in 1899 was 255,000 tons, of a value of 5 million
marks, against only 164,000 tons with a value of
less than 3 million marks in 1898, 176,000 tons in
1897, 95,000 in 1896, 74,000 in 1895, and only
43,000 tons with a value of less than a million marks
in 1886. Compared with thirty years earlier it was
in 1898 more than four times as much (62.35 kilos per
head against 15.21). Of cement, 26,000 tons were
imported in 1899, against 17,000 in 1897, and only
8,000 in 1895. Several other articles show figures
of equal interest, as, for instance, the increased amount
of dyeing material. Metals were imported in 1899
and 1898 to the value of 23 million marks against 16
millions in 1897, and 13 in 1896; and machinery
(including lately some electric machines) to the value
of 18 million marks in 1899, 19 millions in 1898,
12 millions in 1897, and 9 millions in 1896. The
decrease of machinery by one million marks in 1899
against an increase of 7 millions in 1898 was largely
due to a smaller import of locomotives, which are 
nowadays also manufactured in the country. The import
of dairy-machines and vessels decreased from about
⅔ to ⅓ of a million, because in 1899 fewer large
creameries were erected. Ships were imported in
1899 to the value of over 7½ million marks, 4¾
millions of this being for steamers, against 7 millions
in 1898, 2½ in 1897, and 3 millions in 1896.
Among raw material imported we find such articles
as flax to the value of 1 million marks, cotton 6
millions, wool 2 millions, and some yarn and thread.
Tanning materials amounted to 5,000 tons in 1899,
against 2,500 in the two preceding years. An
interesting import is that of books, mostly, of course,
Swedish, the value of which in 1899 was 1¾ million
marks and 1½ million in the two preceding years. Of
more doubtful meaning is what we learn from the
import figures of piece-goods in cotton, wool, linen,
and knitted goods. The import reached the
considerable figures of 19 millions in 1898, and 18
millions in 1897, against 14½ millions in 1896;
which, of course, indicates the progress of popular
wealth. In 1899 it was again less, being only 14
millions; cotton goods representing 4 million marks,
against the 6 millions of 1898, and woollens
representing 6 millions instead of 9. This difference is
undoubtedly due to the establishment of mills in the
country itself, which had now begun to bring their
wares into the home-market; but on account of
the protective tariff this is a progress of more than
doubtful utility to the country.

Trade with various countries presents several points
of interest concerning the economic situation and calls
for consideration, especially as regards the influence
exercised by the tariff relations with Russia. The
trade with Russia is, of course, the largest, and would
probably be so even if a special tariff did not contribute
to such a result. In 1899 the commerce amounted to
140 million marks, of which 85 millions were
represented by import and barely 55 by export. In 1898
the total was 132 millions, 82 import and 51 export;
in 1897, 120 millions, 72 import, 48 export; in 1896,
103 millions, 55 import, 48 export. When more
reciprocity was introduced in 1859, trade increased at
once; the export to Russia in 1861-3 was three times
what it had been in the previous decade. In the
years 1867-9 the trade with Russia was 52 per cent.
of the whole commerce with other countries. As the
rouble went down in value, particularly, for instance,
during the war with Turkey in 1877, this for the
moment caused a larger export from Russia to Finland
and less import from Finland to Russia; since, when
the value of money sinks, prices in the country do not
at once follow those of international trade, whose
prices are expressed in the money of the world. In
the seventies commerce increased with other countries,
without, however, diminishing that with Russia. The
above figures show that it is especially the imports
from Russia which have increased of late. The larger
part of this trade is a natural enough consequence of
the neighbouring position of the two countries and the
difference in their productions. It is due to no
tariff-favour that an import takes place from Russia of 37
million marks’ worth of grain, rye 158,000 tons, worth
24 million marks (including rye-flour 90,000 tons with
a value of 14½ million marks, and unground rye, 68,500
tons with a value of 9½ million marks), 23,000 tons of
wheat-flour with a value of over 7 million marks, 6000
tons of barley with a value of 1 million marks, 3000
tons of malt at a value of over 500,000 marks,
11,000 tons of oats with a value of 1½ million marks,
and some buck-wheat and millet with a value of one
million marks. A more doubtful matter is the import
of 6700 tons of maize from Russia, since it is free
of duty, while maize from other countries pays duty.
The same is the case with pork, salted or otherwise
preserved, and apples which are imported from Russia
to the value of about a million marks. Then there is
the relatively valuable import already mentioned of
4 million marks’ worth of bran and oil cakes, of which
the greater part comes from Russia; there is also meat
and other animal produce, and 25 million eggs with a
value of 1¼ million marks. Also we have one million
marks’ worth of potato-meal, onions, and other
vegetables; flax-seed to the value of one million marks;
crushed bone half a million marks, and hide worth
2 million marks. The advantage for Finland is
doubtful in the case of those goods which are
imported duty-free from Russia, alone of all countries;
such as those mentioned above as well as petroleum
and other oils valued at 3 million marks; ready-made 
clothing valued at about 2 million marks; cotton
piece-goods to the value of 3 million marks; woollens
to the value of 1½ million marks, some linen goods,
and again some yarn, and thread valued at 1½ million
marks; shoes to the value of one million marks; and
finally 2½ million marks’ worth of rubber goods,
especially rubber shoes, which are much used in this
northern climate. We have also those articles on
which some duty is paid, but less duty than when they
are imported from other countries, such as 24,000
tons of sugar of the value of 8 million marks; half the
Finnish import of tobacco; and the wines and liqueurs
which are, still less than tobacco, a cheap product in
Russia. On the other hand, the export of Finland to
Russia consists partly of articles whose import would
be natural from a neighbouring country, such as butter
and milk, cattle and fish to St. Petersburg, firewood
to the value of 3 million marks, hides to the value
of 3 million marks, wooden articles, and so on. But
here it must be admitted that the tariff advantage,
though by no means so considerable as in the case of
the imports from Russia to Finland, is important; it
favours even such articles as pulp, cellulose and paper,
of which 14 million out of 17½ million marks’ worth
goes to Russia, as well as other goods, such as
machinery, metal ware, yarn, thread, piece-goods, glass,
earthenware and china, of which we spoke when
discussing the export of these articles.

England holds first place among the countries
receiving exports from Finland; even more decidedly
than is shown by the Custom-house statistics, because
some exports to England pass over other countries
near Finland. According to these statistics, however,
the total export to England in 1899 was of the value
of 55 million marks, included in this amount being
12 million marks’ worth of butter, and a third of the
great export of wood. Comprised in this latter export
are battens to the value of 17½ million marks, and
planks and deals to the value of 7½ millions, besides
forms of wood exported to England in larger quantity
than to any other country, such as boards to the value
of 7 millions, pit-props to the value of 2⅓ millions,
bobbins and squares for bobbins to the value of one
million, paper to the value of 3¾ millions, and
pasteboard to the value of one million. Other exports
include oats to the value of one million marks, besides
tar and some other articles. On the other hand,
England imports into Finland machinery and other
ironware to the value of 5¼ million marks, steamers
among which the ships above 700 tons are of the
value of 4¾ million marks, yarn, cheap linen and mats
worth 3½ millions, and tallow to the value of one
million marks. Wheat-flour and meat come, of course,
from other countries, especially the United States, only
passing through England; which is also the case with
cotton to the value of 3½ million marks, and one
million marks’ worth of wool. The total import from
England in 1899 was of the value of about 41 million
marks.

In the commerce between Finland and Germany,
on the contrary, the imports are the greater,
representing 81½ million marks against 16½ million export.
The import in 1899 was 6½ million marks larger than
in 1898, when, like the import from England, it was
again 9 million marks higher than in 1897, and again
in that year 7 million marks higher than in 1896.
It was largely represented by German merchandise,
such as rye and rye-flour, to the value of 10 million
marks, woollens 3 millions, clothes one million, hops
half a million, seeds one million, sugar one million,
plums one-third of a million, drugs one-third of a
million, cement half a million, besides iron, ironware,
and bicycles, particularly electric machines, and some
of the hides imported into Finland. As an
intermediary Germany imports many other articles,
including coffee to the value of 6½ million marks, and, also
as an intermediary, most of the tobacco and wine sent
from there to Finland, which last item is of the value
of about one million marks. On the other hand, the
exports to Germany include boards worth one-third of
a million marks, battens 2⅔ millions, and pasteboard
worth one million marks. Trade with Germany has
suffered by the recent protective duties, as, for instance,
the export of wood from Finland to Germany. Exports
from Germany into Finland were affected by the
restrictive measures which the government in St.
Petersburg ordered to be introduced into Finland, too,
in August 1893; but part of these were only in force
till the Commercial Treaty of 1894 was signed. As
a result, commerce between Finland and Germany
decreased between 1892 and 1893 from 50½ to 40
million marks, while, on the other hand, commerce
with Denmark, for instance, increased from 15½ to 20
million marks.

Denmark has a proportionately considerable
commerce with Finland, the total imports from Finland
being 15 million marks, including 4 million marks’
worth of boards and 8½ millions of butter, the latter
partly <i>en route</i> to England. The exports to Finland
are of the value of 11½ millions, including machines,
iron plates, and other metal-ware, cement, meat, a
million marks’ worth of cotton, textile goods, and
Cognac, in most of which articles, however, it acts
as intermediary.

Sweden exports to Finland 13½ million marks’
worth of iron, steel, ironware (including agricultural
and electric machines), cement, bricks, grain, books,
pictures, and a great number of other articles. Its
imports from Finland, on the other hand, amount
only to a value of 7 million marks, among which are
butter to the value of 1½ million; oats, half a million;
some salmon; heavy timber from the State forests of
Finland to the value of 1¼ million, which is imported
by the Swedish mill-owners; firewood to the value
of ¼ million marks; and other details. Some
tendency to a decrease in this trade has been visible
since the recent development of more direct
communication between other countries and Finland,
especially in regard to the butter-trade with England.
Also the late protective tariffs in Sweden have been
a hindrance to trade, as was the high protective
tariff of 1834, which contributed largely to reduce the
once large trade between the two countries. There
is not any considerable commerce with Norway; on
the side of Finland it consists mainly in the
purchase of herrings, the value of which import in 1899
was about half a million marks.

The export trade to France in 1899 was of the value
of 14 million marks, including battens to the value of
4 millions, boards 5⅓ millions, planks and deals 1¼
millions, and wood for pulp 1⅓ millions, the latter
being carried to France, instead of being changed
into pulp or cellulose in Finland, on account of the
French duty. It is noticeable that Finland purchases 1½
million marks’ worth of Cognac and only half a million
marks’ worth of wine, half of the wine being taken
through Germany. There is an import of wheat-meal
to the value of half a million marks; and the total
imports were worth 4⅓ millions.

Spain buys planks and deals to the value of
4 million marks, battens to the value of 2 million,
boards one million; in all an import worth 7½ millions;
and she exports about half this value to Finland,
the export including salt, wine, raisins, and some
other articles. During the war with the United States
in 1898, the Spanish import of wood decreased by
nearly 2 millions, but has now again increased.

The commerce with Holland consists mainly of
the sale of wood to Holland, especially boards and
battens, the total export from Finland being worth
8 million marks. The commerce with Belgium is
more equally divided, a great number of articles
being imported to Finland from Antwerp, as for instance
rice, railway-waggons, and rope. The total export from
Belgium was of the value of about 5½ million marks;
while Belgium purchases to the value of 7 millions,
including battens to the value of 2½ millions, and
nearly one million marks’ worth of boards and other
forms of wood.

From the United States Finland only purchases
cotton to the value of 500,000 marks. The direct
commerce has not developed to any great extent.

As a remarkable example of commercial progress
we will mention the sale of butter. In 1887 Sweden
took the greater part, 3¼ million kilos, Russia took
2½ million, Germany three-quarters of a million,
Denmark one-third of a million kilos, and England
still less. In 1894 Denmark was the chief purchaser
with 7¼ million kilos, England next with 3½ millions,
Russia had decreased her import to 1⅓ million, and
Sweden and Germany theirs to one-third of a million
each. In 1899 England, really the chief consumer,
was at the head with 5¼ millions; Denmark, the
great dealer in butter, being next with 3⅔ millions;
Sweden bought half a million, Russia one-third of
a million, and Germany one-sixth of a million kilos.
The total export in 1897 showed an increase of 4½
million kilos, it being 15½ millions instead of 11, of
which the English share of the increase was 2½ million
and the Danish 2 million kilos.

It is the import duty which is the great enemy of
commerce, especially the protective duty which hinders
the profitable distribution of labour between various
countries; and we may notice that disturbing effects
are much less a consequence of duties imposed on
articles which cannot be produced in the country
itself, where the whole increased value goes to benefit
the treasury, and where at the utmost the consumption 
is deranged, than of these protective duties. Also
the Finnish tariff has been reformed, although much
less than most of the other departments of public life.
In speaking of this question, we must first of all recall
the peculiar position of this tax in the Finnish
constitution. Here the system still prevails which from
1772 to 1809 was found in Sweden, by which the
monarch could, without the co-operation of the
Estates, regulate the customs tariff. It is probable
that, if the Estates had had the same influence here
as in other matters, they would have introduced the
more liberal principles then prevailing. It must,
however, be acknowledged that the Government, in the
tariff of 1869, the main points of which are still in
existence, has undertaken a comparatively considerable 
reform. The tariff certainly gives wide protection
to most of the manufactured articles, but imposes little
or no duty on the raw material which is so important
for the manufacturing and other industries, or on
articles which are necessaries of life. Commerce also
progressed considerably after the reduction of this
tariff. From a financial point of view nothing now
hinders the entire abolition of tariff protection;
since in Finland, as elsewhere, only duties which are
not essentially protective, such as those on sugar,
coffee, tea, tobacco, alcoholic drinks, together with the
excise duties on brännvin and beer, produce large
amounts. The greatest difficulty in this respect is
caused by the relations of Finland with Russia.
Certain diminutions of the Finnish import duty would
occasion new restrictions in the commerce with Russia.
This certainly ought not to decide a question which is
of so vital an importance to the whole development
of the country.

A treaty made between Russia and Spain in 1888,
in which Finland shared, was a step in the direction of
greater liberty. Spain obtained facilities in Finland
for the import of its salt (with a duty of 25 penni per
100 kilos, against 50 for other countries), for its wine,
oil, &c., and again made concessions about the import
of wood, tar, &c., from Finland. But the most
important of these concessions were also given to other
countries which gave Finland the most favourable
tariff, as, for instance, France, Italy, and Portugal.
Some of Russia’s treaties with other countries might
also be quoted as profitable for Finland.

During the first half century of Finland’s union with
Russia, the customs duties were arranged on varying
bases. For a short time there was a certain amount
of reciprocity, but early in the twenties this was
changed in the one-sided interest of Russia.
According to the decree of 1835, not only could Russian
merchandise be imported free of duty into Finland,
except brännvin, which was forbidden to be imported,
but foreign wares could also be imported without
paying any duty whatever by land or by ship across Lake
Ladoga. On the other hand, free import to Russia
was only allowed to Finnish merchandise indicated in
particular lists; all the rest had to pay the same
duties as foreign imports. This system was both
economically and financially a great loss to Finland.
However, in the decree of 1859, Alexander II.
declared that he found it “necessary to introduce greater
reciprocity in the commercial relations between Russia
and Finland.” This decree increased, therefore, the
number of articles which could be introduced free of
duty into Russia, and, on the other hand, imposed
financial duties on the import of certain Russian
articles into Finland. But in 1885, after Finland’s
tariff had been reformed in a liberal manner in 1869,
and Russia’s tariff, on the contrary, had been increased
in the beginning of the eighties, the decree of 1859
was modified so that several important manufactured
products imported from Finland, when these consisted
of goods also made in Russia, had to pay a duty
equivalent to the difference in duties on raw material,
half-finished products and parts of machinery, the
Finnish duty on such raw material from foreign
countries being lower than the Russian. In fact,
however, the duty now imposed was somewhat higher than
could be counterbalanced by these advantages. For
certain Finnish articles a maximum import for goods
under this low duty, or duty free, was fixed, a
limitation not unknown in the decree of 1869, but now
again enlarged. The principle was in this manner
laid down of the protection of Russian manufactures
against Finnish competition. Later, in January 1890,
a committee was nominated to discuss tariff unity
with Russia, but the difficulty of executing the
proposals now formulated for this purpose caused
the discussion to drift on without any result. After
deliberations by fresh committees a new ordinance
was published, which had been proposed by the
Russian Minister of Finance and approved by the
Finnish Senate in May 1897, which limited still
more the free import from Finland to Russia, and
increased the differential duties, increasing, on the other
hand, the former maximum import in the case of some
articles. In Finland it was now believed that the
matter was finally settled, especially as the clause in
the treaty of 1894 with Germany, according to which
the import duty in Finland could have been increased
by 50 per cent. of the difference between the Finnish
and Russian tariff, was not utilised. In 1893 the
Finnish Senate had been ordered to introduce measures
for the increase of the Finnish tariff up to the figures
of the Russian, but it had recommended the 
abandonment of this plan, and had not received any further
communication. This fact, too, contributed to the belief
that a final arrangement had been made. Nevertheless,
in July 1900 the Senate received a new communication 
from the Governor-General to the effect that the
Emperor had decided in the beginning of May to order
a reconsideration of the manner in which the Finnish
tariff could be identified with that of the empire, and
free trade between the countries perhaps be
established; and that for this purpose a new committee
would be nominated composed of Russian authorities
as well as of some Finnish delegates. It was the
desire of the Russian Minister of Finance that the
Finnish tariff should be brought up to the Russian
level before the end of 1903, when new treaties with
several Powers would be under discussion, and it would
presumably be useful to raise the duties to a high
amount, on which concessions might be given. We
see here another proof of the difficulties of treaties
when used as a means of obtaining larger liberty. We
see also a remarkable expression of the small regard
which the Russians have for the interests of Finland, and
also how little they care for the stability of the tariff,
and the whole economical situation which depends on it.

The present rule is that all Russian merchandise
can be introduced free into Finland, with the exception
of brännvin, which is forbidden, and of sugar, tobacco,
wine, liqueurs, and margarine, which pay much smaller
duties when coming into Finland from Russia than
the same articles from other countries; so much less,
indeed, that already the duties on sugar now imported
from Russia instead of from other countries represents
yearly a loss of several millions. On the other hand,
Finland is only allowed to export to Russia certain
products of agriculture and other industries of the
same character. Some wares must on import into
Russia be accompanied by certificates showing that
they originate from Finland. Other articles mentioned
when speaking of the production of iron and iron
wares, copper and copper wares, earthenware and glass,
textile, spun and woven goods, as well as paper, pulp,
and cellulose, are imported under somewhat lower
duties, but in the case of most of these articles only
a very limited import is allowed. The manufacturing
industries governed by these rules are those of the
greatest importance to Finland. Other manufactured
articles pay the same duty as those imported from
other countries. On the side of Russia it is an
accepted principle that the Finnish manufactures must
not be favoured at the cost of the Russians, and that
the duties which they pay shall be equivalent to the
advantage gained by their cheaper and partly free
import of raw material. This is right. But it is a
very curious development of this principle when the
Russian Government also demands that the Finlanders
shall pay for their advantages in water-power and wood,
and that they shall import only certain quantities of
their products. This is to regard Finland from an
economic and not only from a financial point of view
as a foreign country. Protection is demanded and
given by such a measure against the simple use of the
natural productive advantages of a country. The
present arrangement is a kind of treaty between two
foreign countries. Some of the concessions under it
are a gain for liberty, but others are one-sided and
hardly just. The good and bad can, of course, only
be seen by examining the details, especially where the
matter in question is the interest of one single country,
which is not necessarily the same as what is for the
general good.

While a tariff union with Russia under the present
protective and prohibitive system would injure the
sound natural portion of Finnish manufactures, it would,
as already said, be entirely destructive of commerce,
trade, and navigation. It would increase the price of
all present imports, — coal, iron and other metals,
machines, and the most common necessaries of life,
such as sugar, coffee, and salt. By destroying the
import trade it would also hinder export, first by
rendering life and production more difficult and costly;
then by diminishing the already small freights which
ships can take home to the country; finally, by
decreasing the value of the means of payment in foreign
countries — its bills of exchange on these countries. If
we consider its influence on commerce, that most useful
aid to civilisation, we shall understand still better the
extent to which this measure would be destructive of
the whole national development. We have no need
to speak here of its influence on the situation in
Russia, on its commerce, agriculture, and business in
general. We have already spoken of the effect of the
high Russian duties on the most important Finnish
manufacturing interests. In reality, all who produce
goods are consumers by the necessities of their life and
their industrial activity. It is calculated that a simple
fisher family consisting of four persons, which is rather
below the general number, would have to pay
eighty-five marks more per annum, fifty-five marks fifty penni
as increased duty on the salt needed for forty barrels
of Baltic herrings prepared for sale, and thirty marks
for such simple necessities as coffee, chickory, iron, &c.
A Finnish cottier who keeps four cows and a horse
would have to pay fifty marks extra for iron, nails,
woollens, coffee, chickory, &c. A common peasant
proprietor with forty cows and five horses would have to pay
fifty-four marks extra for iron and nails, and seven
marks twenty penni for artificial manure, or a total of
240 marks more. It is not certain that a larger
revenue would be obtained for the Treasury; the moderate
Finnish tariff, just because of its moderate and less
protective character, brings in much more per head of the
population than the Russian tariff — not far from three
and a half times as much, the last year’s average being
from thirteen to fourteen marks per head in Finland
against four marks in Russia. The truth is that the
Russian system is in the highest degree harmful to
Russia herself, increasing the price of such raw material
as pig iron by 70 per cent., billets of iron by 45
per cent., and steel by 35 per cent.; increasing
enormously the cost of such enterprises as the
construction of railways and factories, the building of
ships, farming, and, indeed, of all industrial life, not to
mention the increased cost of such common things as
salt, coffee, and sugar. In Finland, all industries and
industrial life in general necessitate commerce with
other countries; and free import from Russia could
not replace this. It is not only that most things
would cost more; but many would be unobtainable
from Russia. It would not, as is the case with tariff
unions between many other countries, be an advance.
It would be an enormous set-back to the whole of
civilisation. It is to be hoped that the Finnish nation
will not be obliged to witness the fulfilment of this
menace.

As shown by the figures of the total Finnish commerce 
with other countries, the value of the import is
as a rule much higher than the export. Partly, this
difference is only apparent; the value of the imports,
which are liable to duty, being calculated more exactly
than the exports. Partly, it is due to the calculation
of the value in both cases being made in Finnish
ports, the import figures being therefore increased by
the addition of cost and profit of commerce and
transport, the export figures being given without this. One
reason for the existence of this surplus, in so far as it
is existent, is that foreign capital is imported to
Finland, where relatively good opportunities exist for its
productive use, such as loans for the building of
railways, or loans (relatively few during the past year or
two) for the development of private industries. Such
borrowed capital is always imported in the form of
articles necessary to life and production, or, what is
possibly more correct, provokes such import. The
surplus is also to some extent caused by the simple
fact that the Finnish commercial marine takes part in
the transport between Finland and other countries,
and in general trade as well. Theodore Wegelius
calculates that out of the 57 millions excess of imports
in 1898, 16¼ millions can be thus explained; out of
the 67 millions in 1899, 2o| millions; and out of 73
millions in 1900, 21½ millions. He arrived at this
result by calculating a freight profit of 80 marks per
ton on the tonnage in 1898, of 90 marks in 1899, and
of 95 marks in 1900, deducting 10 per cent, of the
whole amount for inland shipping, which has nothing
to do with foreign commerce.

Finland’s commercial marine is not without
importance, but has not increased much during the last
few years. It consisted at the end of 1889 of 2,281
ships, with a minimum tonnage of 19 tons, and a total
tonnage of 318,000 tons; in 1896 of 2,132 ships and
313,000 tons; in 1876 there were 1,900 ships and
285,000 tons. The reason of this diminished increase
is that the marine continues to consist mainly of
sailing ships. It was composed in 1899 of 2,020 sailing
ships, with a tonnage of 271,000 tons, and only 261
steamers with a tonnage of 47,000 tons. It may
also be mentioned that nowadays pine as a building
material has been to some degree superseded by
oak, which is not common in Finland. Part of
this marine, including the steamers, consists of very
small ships used chiefly between the inland ports, and
especially on the lakes. Small steamers, or launches,
are owned here by most of the larger proprietors. On
the sea in 1899 there were 1759 ships, with 271,000
tons; on Lake Ladoga 107 ships, with 16,000 tons, of
which seven were steamers with 400 tons; and on the
Saima Lake 415 ships with 32,000 tons, of which
seventy-two were steamers with 4,000 tons. Most of
the sailing ships are owned by men living on the
coast outside the towns. In modern times numerous
very small and very large ships and fewer middle-sized 
ships have been built. But on the whole the
sailing ships of Finland are now antiquated, and it
is an extraordinary commercial chance which during
recent years has allowed some old valueless wooden
ships to earn during the year the whole value of the
ship. If Finland desires to maintain her position on
the sea she must acquire steamers. While on the
whole shipbuilding has been inconsiderable of late,
relatively more steamers were built during the years
1889 to 1891; and again during recent years a
greater number of steamers have been built. But
according to the whole tonnage Finland does not now
stand high in the ranks of ship-owning nations. In
present circumstances, and in imitation of other
countries, there has naturally been a question of State
subsidies for certain lines of steamers, especially for the
export of butter to England.

It is in consequence of the slower progress of the
steam part of the marine that Finland has not kept
her share of foreign commerce. In 1899 the total
number of clearances for ships of 19 tons or over was:
Arrivals, 8,185, with 1,999,000 tons; outgoing ships,
8,208, with 2,005,000 tons. In 1876, when there
were more small sailing ships, the figures were:
Arrivals, 9,364, with 1,314,000 tons; outgoing ships,
9,220, with 1,311,000 tons. In 1866 the figures
were: Arrivals, 3,742, with 517,000 tons; outgoing
ships, 3,901, with 529,000 tons. In 1868 the figures
were much higher, and they have of course moved
with the commerce. A considerable number of the
incoming ships are in ballast, though a very small part
of the outgoing, the reason being that there is not
enough return freight to be equivalent to the large
outgoing freight of wood. Thus the ships going to
the Baltic have a specially cheap freight home of
merchandise, such as coal and iron, and to Finland
also of grain. In Finland in 1899 only 5,098 ships,
with 1,021,000 tons, came in with freight, and 3,087,
with 978,000 tons, representing half of the total
tonnage (amongst these being the greater portion
of the sailing vessels), had only ballast. Almost all
the outgoing ships, on the contrary, had freight, these
numbering 7,210, with 1,825,000 tons, against only
998, with 180,000 tons, which were in ballast. These
last were evidently only a number of very small vessels.
Most of the space freighted with cargo is on board
steamers, the amount being in 1899: Arrivals,
757,000 tons on steamers, against 264,000 on sailing
vessels: Outgoing, 1,250,000 tons on steamers, 575,000
tons on sailing vessels. From 1867 to 1869 the
proportion was entirely different, being at arrival only
36 per cent. for steamers and 64 per cent. for sailing
vessels; at departure (where wood fills a larger space),
17 and 83. Now the proportion is again entirely
changed. In 1899 arriving steamers had 76 per cent.
of their space freighted, sailing vessels only 24 per
cent.; and even at departure the steamers had 70
per cent. and sailing only 30 per cent. As a result
of this the Finnish commercial marine, which still
consists mainly of sailing vessels, now plays a much
smaller part. In 1867-9 Finland’s share of the
freighted tonnage at arrival of ships with freight was
80 per cent., against 20 per cent. for ships from
other countries; in 1894-6 only 63 against 37;
in 1899, 60 against 40. Among the outgoing ships
in 1867-9, proportion was 69 against 31; in
1894-6, 43 against 57; in 1899, 45 against 55.
Next to Finnish ships the German ships hold the
first rank. Until recently it was English ships. The
German ships represent now about 10 per cent. of
the total, the Norwegian about 9½, the English and
the Danish each above 9, the Swedish 7¼ per cent.

In 1895 about 6,000 families were supposed to live
by fishing. They had 9,000 boats, all small, manned
with from two to four men. The whole take was
reckoned at from 17 to 18 million kilos, of which
11 million were from the sea, 5½ from the lakes, and
about three-quarters of a million from the rivers. In
reality, more was probably obtained; the reports are not
complete. The largest quantity, 8⅓ million kilos, was
represented by the Baltic herring, or strömming. The
common herring, of which three hundred years ago an
enormous quantity were caught in the Baltic, is now rare.
The small anchovy, or “hvassbuk,” has a certain
importance in the south-west. From the sea are obtained
1½ million of common inland fish, pike, bass, perch,
&c., which here are found in the sea, because it
contains only a very little salt. Half a million kilos
of salmon-trout are also caught, and the same quantity
of smelts; codfish, flounders, eels, &c., are also found.
From the lakes are obtained 3½ million kilos of the
commoner kind of fish, and about 2 million kilos
of excellent salmon-like fish, besides salmon,
salmon-trout, and a fish in Finland called “siklöja,” or
“muikka,” well known, under the name of “white-fish,” 
as one of the finest fishes in the western part
of the great American lakes; also sik or gwyniad.
Salmon holds, of course, a very considerable place,
especially in the rivers and lakes, and is, next to
the Baltic herring, the most important fish; it is
exported to the value of more than half a million
marks. Salmon-fishing furnishes excellent sport in the
northern rivers, in the Kemi, Ijo, and Uleå; in the
Kumo there are more salmon-trout. In Lake Ladoga
sturgeons are taken so big that the fishermen, when they
take them in to St. Petersburg, sometimes prefer to let
them swim behind the boat. Of crayfish half a million
kilos are now exported, to the value of about 200,000
marks. Seal shooting is of importance; less, however,
in Lakes Ladoga and Saima, where certain specimens
of seal are supposed to indicate that these fresh-water
lakes were once connected with the White Sea.

The Finlanders are not abreast of the times in their
treatment of fish; generally it comes into the market
dead, and the new method of killing the fish at once
and transporting it in ice or refrigerators is not much
known. At Ekenäs, in the south-west, some anchovies
and Baltic herrings are canned or otherwise prepared.
In some places the smoke-method of Kiel is employed.
The Finlanders themselves eat most of their fishes
strongly salted, a national taste hardly beneficial to the
health of the people.

The fishery rights in Finland are regulated in
ordinary fashion and comparatively well. In the
middle of the eighteenth century, when enclosures
began to take place, efforts were also made to allot the
right of fishing among the inhabitants, in the same
manner as the lands were divided. To a great extent,
however, the fisheries are still used in common, or
according to peculiar regulations made by the villagers
themselves. The general rule is that one-third of the
streams shall be open in order that the fish may pass.
Only the fishing rights in closed lakes from which
there is only one outlet, and which do not form parts of
larger water-courses, may be held as private property.
The government owns most of the salmon fisheries,
and some other people are in possession of peculiar
rights arising from old customs. On the sea the
landowners have rights as far as 1200 feet out into the
water, reckoned from six feet depth. Everybody,
however, may fish with hooks and lines. Fresh legislation 
will now extend the right of private persons in
certain directions; for instance, in the sea and the
great lakes to a distance of 500 metres. Also a more
precise definition will be given of closed waters.
Among waters which are subject to private claims may
also be reckoned small gulfs from the sea which do not
exceed eight square kilometres in extent. Measures will
be taken against the fouling of the water by the bark
of floated trunks as well as against disturbing specially
protected places by dragging the lakes for iron ore.

Until now very little has been done for artificial
fish culture. The people themselves transplant fish
and roe by old primitive methods. Very successful
experiments, however, have been made with several
American varieties. There is no doubt but that the
enormous lake area of Finland, representing 11 per
cent. of the whole country, and in a large part of the
south more than half the country, might produce a
much larger catch, as well as the sea near the coast.
In the Finnish lakes the catch is only 1½ or at the
utmost 3 kilos of fish per hectare, against 25 in East
Prussia, and 45 in Silesia. Some private societies,
including one on the river Vuoski, do good work.
The Government Inspector ought to have larger means
at his disposal. There is certainly a source of wealth
here which it would pay to develop in the same
manner as, for instance, in the United States, where
the natural conditions are very similar.

If we look at a map of Finland we notice that the
situation of Northern Finland is the same as that of
Russia before Peter the Great. It is a large country
without any outlet to the sea, although the sea is not
very distant. In fact, this northern coast is endowed
by Nature with great riches which only need to be
utilised. The adjoining Russian coast on the Polar Sea,
and also the coast running down into the White Sea,
are as rich as that of the adjacent Norwegian coast,
offering the best opportunity for fishing in the world,
and rich in cod and other fishes. The Gulf Stream
keeps it open the whole year, and it differs in this
respect from the coast of Finland farther south. It
has at least three most excellent harbours,
Peisenfjord, Jekaterin (since 1900 called Alexandrovsk),
and Jeretik, of which only the harbour of Jekaterin
is now being utilised, owing to measures taken by
the late able Governor of Archangel, Engelhardt.
There are excellent localities for docks, wharfs, and
everything else needed in a great harbour. In fact,
the poor population of the interior has during a
number of years regularly migrated to this rich coast
in order to participate in the fishing. For some years,
from the middle of the century until about 1875,
there was also a regular emigration to the Norwegian
ports, every year some people remaining there after
the fishing season. Now when opportunities are better
at home, and more emigration has also been going on
to the United States, fewer of the fishermen remain
to increase the Finnish population of the Norwegian
Finmark. The reason why a larger number prefer the
Norwegian to the neighbouring Russian coast is said
to be the more advanced state of civilisation which
is found there; merchants and doctors abound, with
means of communication such as telegraphs and
steamships, and, not least, good administration and
order. So at least the fishermen themselves say.

There has often been a question of attracting the
Finlanders to the Russian coast also. If this is to be
done, it will certainly be necessary to introduce Finnish
jurisdiction. An exchange of Finnish and Norwegian
territory has been suggested, but the more natural
method of procedure would be to give at least part of
the Russian coast to Finland. It was only in 1826
that this whole northern territory was regularly
divided between Russia and Norway. For at least
three centuries the Danish-Norwegian Government
had collected taxes along the whole coast, part of
which is called the coast of Murman, that is, of the
Normans, because the Northmen were here in olden
times. Russia had at the same time taken taxes from
those of her subjects which were wandering about
in the interior. Nobody thought of Finland in the
division of 1826. In more liberal days, in 1864,
a promise was first given that Finland should have
part of the coast and of its harbours, in return for
a slip of land ceded to Russia in the south-east of
Finland, where the Imperial rifle-factory of Systerbäck
is situated; but the promise was not kept. There is
now hardly any population in this great northern
country. On the coast there are a couple of
thousand persons living by fishing, about 1000 Finns, 250
Russians, 150 Russian Carelians, and some Lapps.
Of these Lapps, who number about 1000 in the
whole Russian Lapmark, a few are Lutherans using
books obtained from Norway; while most are of the
Greek Orthodox Church, knowing, however, literally
only three words about religion, the first three of the
Confession. The great country farther south, as far
as Kem, a small place not far from the renowned
Solovetski Island Monastery on the White Sea, is
inhabited by at the most some 20,000 Carelians,
separated from the Carelians in Finland by their religion and
lack of culture. In fact, the Greek Orthodox religion
is next to impossible for these northern countries,
for the simple reason that it does not allow the use
of meat, nor of milk or eggs on the greater number
of days in the year, whereas strong animal food seems
to be an absolute necessity for people who live near
the Pole. Also the land can hardly be utilised for
any other purpose than that of stock-raising. There
is enough grazing, at present very little utilised, but
nobody will raise stock when milk and other produce
may not be used. It is unnecessary to explain to
what use the Finnish administration and the Finnish
people might put these natural conditions, which are
in many ways rather favourable. Also the streams on
which the wood must be carried down, which is now
growing in value in the Northern Finnish Government
forests, run either to the Polar or to the White Sea.
From the Norwegian ports in the same district, fishing,
seal-catching, and whaling has lately been carried on in
northern latitudes, bringing in between one and two
million kroner per annum. Finally, the new Russian
port of Jekaterin would undoubtedly be a less
expensive and more decidedly successful work in
Finnish hands. There would, in all these regions, be
numerous openings for Finnish activity, fishing,
navigation and commerce; while the rights of nobody would
be violated, because until now there has hardly been
any population whatever found here. It would mean
a new era of colonisation, as in Siberia and America.

<chapter name="VIII. Money and Banking">

<h2><small>CHAPTER VIII</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>MONEY AND BANKING</small></small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> monetary system is closely connected with the
development of banking. This was the opinion of
the Estates of Finland at the Diet of Borgå in 1809,
when they professed their intention of making the
Russian silver rouble the monetary unit, and asked
that they might establish a National Bank in order
to put it into circulation. We find the same
connection throughout financial history. Good money is
the basis of credit in all its branches; and in Finland,
as in other civilised countries, the National Bank and
other monetary institutions ensure its circulation and
to some extent themselves create the media of
circulation.

The monetary situation of the country was a
curious one during the first generation after the union
with Russia. Notwithstanding the efforts of the
government, money continued to circulate in Swedish
paper more than in Finnish or Russian roubles. The
Russian armies had brought Russian paper money
into the country, but notwithstanding the decision
of the Diet in 1809, the people continued to prefer
Swedish notes. The Russian notes were irredeemable,
and neither these nor Russian silver money were
known to the people. The continuous decrease in
the value of Swedish notes consequent upon too large
an issue contributed rather to spread them in the
interior of Finland. The merchants, who received more
of these debased notes for the same quantity of
merchandise, made large profits by placing the notes with
their customers, who only understood later that they
were steadily decreasing in value. As is always the
case when money is decreasing in value the lower
classes and the remoter districts of the country were
the chief sufferers, because it took time before the
decreased value became known there. Even in the
interior of Eastern Finland commerce still took the
same old route as before, over Ostrobothnia into
Sweden. Only the province of Viborg, which was
used to Russian money, because the people were
accustomed to Russian rule, and trade with St. Petersburg
was larger, continued to employ it. It was reckoned
that at this period half the money in the country
consisted of Swedish notes. Decrees were issued then
and repeatedly afterwards that taxes should be paid
in roubles, that all bills and commercial arrangements
should be negotiated in them, and that the small
Swedish notes should be confiscated and given to the
informant, but without result. Several times the
government were forced to allow taxes to be paid in Swedish
money, because otherwise it could get nothing; and
the outcome was that during the greater part of
this early period, notwithstanding all decrees, matters
remained <i>in statu quo</i>. The Finnish Bank which was
now established tried in vain to replace the small
Swedish notes by its own issue of notes of twenty, fifty, and
seventy-five kopecks, as well as of one, two, and for some
time of four roubles. By 1821 it had succeeded in
getting a little over 2 million roubles into circulation;
but this amount decreased afterwards till in 1833 it
was 828,000 roubles; and it was some time later
before it again rose to between 2 and 3 million
roubles. It was only in 1840, when the Finnish
Bank was open to exchange silver, and at the same
time had been entirely reorganised, that redemption
began; and in the three years 1840-3, a little more
than 6 million daler in Swedish banknotes, worth
about 3 million daler in silver, or 12½ million marks
of Finland’s present money, was redeemed. In the
Northern province of Uleåborg it took nearly twenty
years before the circulation of Swedish money was
replaced by what was now declared to be the national
money.

At the Diet of Borgå the Estates had demanded
the establishment of a “National Exchange and Loans
Bank,” and had requested that this should be
supervised by representatives of the Estates, according
to the old Swedish constitution. This last demand
was not conceded, although afterwards four auditors
were appointed, one representative from each Estate.
The first establishment was called the “Exchange,
Loan and Deposit Office”; then this name was changed
to “The Finland Bank of Exchange, Deposit, and
Loans”; the institution being best known simply as
“The Finnish Bank.” The Bank with its small notes
had a difficult task to keep pace with the circulation;
its capital was altogether too small for any considerable
activity; and as it was permitted by the authorities
to lend money for long periods to landed proprietors
and manufacturers, it had hardly any means for real
commercial transactions.

A great step in advance was taken in 1840 when
it was finally decided that the Bank should not only
issue notes in larger amounts of three, ten, and
twenty-five roubles, but should also exchange them
on demand into silver. This had become possible
because the same reform, the redemption of notes into
silver, had been carried in Russia during the previous
year of 1839. The older irredeemable Russian and
Finnish paper money disappeared then from
circulation. The decision of the Diet in Borgå in 1809
that the silver rouble should be legal money was
now finally carried out. There was, however, this
weak point in the banking law of 1840, that the
Bank of Finland was also obliged to exchange Russian
banknotes into silver. The dangerous consequences
of this decision appeared in 1854, when the Russian
Bank was forced by the Crimean War to stop the
payment of its notes.

Great progress had in several ways taken place in
the principles and practice of bank administration,
but in some other respects the old principles
continued in force too strongly in the Bank’s method of
transacting business. There was too much delay in
obtaining loans and discounting bills. Even in places
where there were branch offices, a demand had to be
sent to the head office of the Bank, which was now
at Helsingfors, and not as at the commencement at
Åbo, and it took days or weeks to obtain an answer.
During the first half of January the Bank was entirely
closed for the audit. The rates of interest and discount
were no longer perfectly immobile, but were changed
by the Government, that is, the Economic Department
of the Senate. The fundamental principle of the
administration continued to be wrong. The directors
thought it their duty to consider the public interest,
instead of acting in a business-like way and considering 
principally the profits of the Bank, the market rate
of interest and discount, and the best possible security.
It continued to lend money in order to prop up divers
industries, not least among these the landed proprietors; 
and new branches were opened. For instance,
when the Crimean War had destroyed half of the
commercial marine, the Bank granted loans for long
periods to naval constructors, also to public associations
and municipalities. It continued to be a favour to
obtain a loan, and instead of rendering service to the
whole public, the Bank assisted a few privileged
persons. By maintaining a rate of interest much
lower than the market rate, and by allowing loans to
remain without amortising, the borrowers were too
often allowed to continue their antiquated business
methods without keeping pace with modern methods.
As a natural consequence of this, such loans lacked
security and were often lost, and the Bank was without
means to render assistance in periods of difficulty.
During the general financial crisis in 1847—8, it was
found necessary to grant debtors a moratorium of
three years, and when the Crimean War and a subsequent 
short expansion of business was followed by
another general crisis in 1857, the Bank was again
without any means. Although the Bank of Finland
had been obliged in 1854 to stop the exchange of its
notes into silver, it had retained the rule which had
regulated their issue, that notes might not be issued in
any greater proportion to its silver than that of fifteen to
seven. It could therefore have exchanged into silver its
own notes, but to redeem those of the Russian Bank
too was of course an entire impossibility. The Bank
could not as a consequence act with the vigour and
elasticity which was necessary in order to satisfy the
demands of the crisis of 1857, as well as of the
following period.

In response to a proposal of the Senate, the
Emperor decreed on the 4th of April 1860, that
Finland should have its own monetary unit, the mark,
or Finnish “markka,” the equivalent of a quarter of
a silver rouble, and divided into 100 penni. It was
obvious that Finland had better have a smaller unit
than the rouble, without losing the connection with
the rouble unit. One advantage gained was that the
new unit, the mark, became identical with the French
silver franc. A Mint was established in Helsingfors in
1861 for coining silver money, one and two mark pieces,
as well as pennis for small change. For the time it
was obligatory to accept the paper money, but several
measures were decided on for the purpose of forcing
silver coins into circulation. A certain amount of
energy was employed, but hardly enough. The Diet
in 1863 sanctioned the proposition of a government
guarantee for a foreign loan of 30 million marks, which
the recently established “Finlands Hypotheksförening” 
(an association of mortgagers of landed property)
desired to obtain. A condition was made that 8 million
marks of the loan should be deposited in the Bank of
Finland. When this had been done, the negotiations
with St. Petersburg were continued, and the consent
of the Russian Minister of Finance to the desired
currency reform was obtained. The Emperor
Alexander II., who had followed the question with great
attention, signed finally in November 1865 a decree
that only coins should be legal tender in Finland;
and that the Bank of Finland notes should only
provisionally, until 13th March 1866, be legal tender
when offered in payment together with silver coins,
of which there was not yet a sufficient quantity in
circulation. This “mynt-realisation,” as it was called,
was not made without difficulty, and it resulted in
considerable loss to many persons because it was not
enacted more rapidly. The notes decreased in value
in Finland as well as in Russia. For a time the
difference between the value of the notes and the
silver increased to 40 per cent., and it was as high as
20 per cent. even during the execution of the reform
itself. The man who had bought paper money at this
low value, and who must now reimburse in silver,
suffered thereby a very considerable loss. A petition
was sent requesting other terms of redemption, but
the Emperor did not think it just to change the
declared ratio between silver and paper; he held that
it would be a breach of good faith. The more recent
conversion of paper into gold in Russia was based on
an opposite view, and took place at the current rate of
exchange, which is quite right and just. An industrial
revolution has taken place when money has decreased
in value, and to increase it arbitrarily involves a new
revolution. The situation was so much the more
difficult because one of the periodical monetary crises
of the world was taking place in 1864-6. Finland
itself suffered from unusually severe famines in 1862,
1865, and 1867. The Bank, after this monetary
reform, was obliged to be much more cautious, as
the large amounts deposited by the Hypotheksföreningen 
had soon been withdrawn.

These difficulties, however, were only of a temporary
nature. By the introduction of the silver standard,
Finland had now obtained a firm basis for its monetary
system. Silver was then the basis of the monetary
system in the most important countries, with the
exception of England. France itself, together with the
Latin Monetary Union and the United States, had both
silver and gold, but in practice they chiefly used silver,
until the great modern production of gold brought
more of this, the most valuable metal, into circulation.
Finland, its Bank, and its whole system of banking and
credit, was now emancipated from the influences of the
fluctuating Russian paper money.

The new order of things worked excellently at
first, but the situation soon changed. In the great
countries which held to a double standard, gold, which
was now produced in quantities greater than the
demand, became the real means of circulation. This
fact was soon recognised by the most important
countries, and when the situation once more changed,
and another excessive production of silver again
menaced the circulation of the gold — since a cheaper
metal will always supplant a dearer — the more
important States, the United States as well as those of
the Latin Union, found it necessary to stop their
free coinage of silver. Then gold alone became the
actual standard; silver coins, which could no longer be
obtained in unlimited quantity from the Mint, were by
this limitation kept up in value, so that they were
only really representatives of the gold which was
circulating, and were soon even of a value double that of
the metal contents. After the Franco-German War,
Germany too adopted the gold standard, without,
however, introducing the franc as the unit, as Finland
had done in its system of silver coins. The formation
of a large monetary union was thereby checked; the
German mark was one-third of the existing Prussian
thaler, and rather an equivalent of the English shilling,
twenty marks making one pound. The Scandinavian
countries introduced at the same time their krone or
krona unit also based on gold, but with a crown as
nearly as possible the equivalent of their older coins.
Silver continued to decrease in value, and it was evident
that, in order that the value of its money might no
longer continue to fluctuate, Finland would be obliged
to follow the common movement. In a few years gold
became the standard coin of all countries except the
silver country, Mexico, and other countries where
its piastres circulate. Silver continued to go down
during the years 1873 to 1876, and the Bank of
Finland acted therefore wisely when, like its
Scandinavian contemporaries, it tried to change its metallic
reserve into gold instead of silver. Nevertheless in
1875 the proportion between gold and silver had not
varied very much from the ordinary ratio of 1 to 15½;
and it was therefore natural that this ratio should be
accepted. Again, however, it took too long a time
before the reform was carried out, and when the gold
standard was finally introduced in 1877 the variations
were already so considerable that the ratio was not
quite just to the debtor, who had borrowed less
valuable money and must now pay back more valuable
coins.

The present coining law was enacted, having obtained
the consent of the Diet, on the 9th August 1877.
According to this law gold is now the only standard;
the unit is the French gramme, and the unit of counting 
is preserved; two gold pieces are coined of 10 and
of 20 marks, containing the same mixture as 10- and
20-franc pieces. Everybody can go to the Mint with
gold and obtain, instead of the metal, through the Bank
of Finland, its equivalent in gold coins with a reduction
of ⅓ per cent. for coining expenses. Gold coins alone
are legal tender for the payment of unlimited amounts.
Also 1- and 2-mark silver pieces are coined, of which,
however, nobody need accept more than 10 marks;
and 25- and 50-penni pieces, of which nobody need
accept more than 2 marks, and finally, copper pieces
of 10, 5, and 1 penni are coined, of which nobody need
accept more than 1 mark. The coins and their
divisions are very practical and convenient. Very
little gold is in circulation. The people prefer
bank-notes, as is the case in most other countries
where it is the custom to have paper of a reliable
character and readily convertible. In reality there
is no reason why gold should circulate instead of
remaining in the cellars of the banks, where it better
serves its principal purpose of maintaining the national
money on a par with the money of the world.
Finland thus acts in the same manner as the
Scandinavian countries and Holland, where the monetary
system is as good as that of any other country. The
main circulation continues to take place by means
of the notes of the Bank of Finland for 5, 10, 20, 50,
100, and 500 marks.

The Bank of Finland has been reorganised in such
a manner that it not only secures the monetary system
of the country, but maintains the national credit better
than before. The organisation of this Bank, and of
the whole national banking system, has been one of
the finest and most important reforms of the excellent
liberal period which followed the accession of Alexander
II. In 1859, before the introduction of the silver
standard, changes were introduced into the Bank with
the intention of forming it into a real, modern
institution of credit; and measures were taken, as soon
as the Estates were again called together, for the still
better safeguarding and development of the institution.
The Swedish political and legal organisation, which
had largely fallen into disuse, was now brought back to
life. The Bank of Finland received a constitution
analogous to that of the Swedish Riksbank, but with
the further advantage that it obtained an independent
management. According to the law of November 9,
1867, voted by the Diet, the Bank is, from January 1,
1868, carried on under the direction of the Estates
represented by their delegates, and in such fashion
that further changes may take place according to
the decision of the Estates, and subject to the
approval of the Finnish government. The Estates
choose four delegates, one from each Estate, as well
as four auditors; and these delegates form an
administration corresponding to the English Board of
Directors. They decide, for instance, according to the
suggestions of the managers, the rates of interest and
discount. The managers — called directors, as in
Germany, Scandinavia, and France — are nominated by
the Emperor, the President is proposed by the Senate
only, and three other managers are proposed by the
delegates of the Estates. At each Diet a Banking
Committee is elected to examine the administration
of the Bank and to propose any new rules which
may be necessary. At the Diet of 1872 a complete
code of rules was adopted, which has been several
times amended. Until 1876 the Bank of Finland
also took care of the Treasury funds, but since that
date a separate Treasury Office, or “Statskontor,”
has been established. The capital of the Bank has
several times been increased by means of a portion
of the profits, and it has now been brought up to 25
million marks, with a reserve which was 9 millions
in 1901, and will shortly be brought up to 15 millions.
At the same time a considerable portion of the profit
of the Bank has been applied by the Diet to the
payment of divers expenses concerning matters which
depend on the Estates.

The main object of the Bank continues to be the
circulation of notes, but there is now established in
necessary connection with this a full modern banking
business. The recently amended rule for the issue of
notes is that the Bank may issue 40 million marks
without any equivalent in gold, this being the minimum
demanded by the circulation according to the experience 
of the worst years since 1890. For the purpose
of giving necessary elasticity to the issue the
government may permit a temporary additional issue of 10
million marks. For all excess the Bank must have
either gold, or foreign exchange, or credit with foreign
correspondents, or bonds of the class which is always
marketable on foreign Bourses. Silver, either in bars
or foreign coins, is excluded according to the last
regulations. The Bank shall, however, always have at
least 20 millions of real gold in hand. Not only notes
but all money deposited on demand must be reckoned
as issue which has to be covered in the above-stated
manner. This system has some resemblance to the
English Bank Act of Sir Robert Peel passed in 1844,
in so far as it allows a certain amount of note-issue
for which no covering of gold is needed, but its details
render it much more elastic, and also more elastic
than the German system and its imitations which
place a heavy tax on a larger issue of notes. An even
more important change is that the Bank, instead of
tying up its resources as was formerly the case, is now
buying foreign and inland bills of exchange, which
mean regular returns with short periods, at the same
time that it is lending on perfectly marketable paper.
The Bank is somewhat stricter than private banks. It
does not like renewal of bills, nor financial bills which
are not a part of real commercial transactions. It
lends less than formerly on paper, and, compared to
the other banks, less on stock than on bonds. Since
1875 it has ceased to lend directly on real estate, and
also prefers to leave loans on merchandise to the other
banks. It has continued to establish branch offices, of
which it has now fifteen. Local committees are formed
at each branch office for granting discounts and loans.

To understand the Finnish banking system it will
be necessary to speak here of the private banks 
established since 1862. Thanks to the work of the late
Henrik Borgström, some of the most important
characteristics of the excellent Scotch banking system
were introduced into Finland by the establishing of
the Union Bank or “Föreningsbanken i Finland.” We
all know how their banking system, together with their
schools, have transformed the Scotch since the middle
of the eighteenth century from a barbarous nation to
probably the first people in the world. The banks in
Finland resemble more than those of any other country
the banks of Scotland. As in Scotland so we find in
Finland a few large, well-organised banks with numerous
branch offices; four banks have at present 115 branches
in forty different places, whereas in 1887 there were
only fifty-nine in twenty-nine places. A few larger
banks can be stronger and better managed than a
great number of small banks; while, through their
branches, a distribution of capital takes place in the
different parts of the country, and the rate of interest
and discount is equalised. A few banks need also
much less cash. Another illustration of this system is
offered by Canada. Compared with the 4000 national
or note-issuing banks of the United States, which are
not allowed to establish branches, the twelve Canadian
banks are much stronger and the rates of interest and
discount are much more equal, to the great benefit
of both lenders and borrowers, and to the special
advantage of the new districts which most need capital.
Sweden has, to some extent, the same system; with
the difference, however, that even the largest banks
with their branches hardly hold the same independent
position with regard to the Riksbank as do the Finnish
banks, especially the three largest. The Scotch “cash
credit” was adopted at once by the Bank of Finland as
soon as the first private bank contemplated the 
introduction of this system. It is a system consisting of
giving credit to any reliable man against deposit of
good paper or the furnishing of good personal security,
with this peculiar feature, that he only pays interest
on the money he actually uses. The system was
first introduced into Denmark ten years later by
the author of this book, by the establishment of the
Landmandsbank there. This plan of calculating interest
only on money actually used is the same as in the
case of current accounts, on which in Finland 2 per
cent. is generally paid; only that the latter case
presupposes money deposited. Cash credit, however,
means that money is lent by the bank, and ordinary
interest paid on this, together with a small amount for
the whole credit, in Finland generally ½ per cent. per
annum. One advantage of this form of credit is that
it frequently gives the bank a chance of following the
whole business of their clients. Another excellent
system brought into use by the Finnish banks is that
of the so-called “post bills,” the issue against a very
small payment (formerly 1 mark per 1000, now
only ½ per 1000) of cheques payable at any branch,
even at any branch of any bank. This is an excellent
means of sending money, particularly valuable where
the post is not sufficiently cheap, as is the case in
Finland since it has come under Russian direction.
For a time the Union Bank issued these bills “to
bearer,” and reissued them when they came back, so
that they were really a kind of note. As we are told
by banking history, cosmopolitan Sweden was one of
the first countries to develop modern banks. It is
even said to have been the first country of modern
times to introduce notes, which were first used there
in the middle of the seventeenth century. Undoubtedly 
the ideas gained during the union with Sweden
have contributed to the development of banking in
Finland. Still more, however, is this an expression of
the high economic position held by the Finlanders.

In one point the Finns have not continued to
imitate the old Scotch system, nor the modern Canadian,
which latter country continues prominent in this
matter. We refer to the liberty of the banks to issue
notes. As will be remembered, this liberty was limited
in Scotland in 1845, the year after the enactment
of the Bank Act in England, to the amount of notes
which the banks then had in circulation; and twice a
year when the Scotch banks need more money they
must send to London for gold, only to send it back
again a short time afterwards. In Finland the Union
Bank began to imitate the Scotch banks by issuing
notes. From 1867 onwards it issued 1½ million marks’
worth of notes; having obtained the recognition of
this right in the banking law of 1866. The Senate
might approve statutes containing the right to issue
notes of an amount equal to the stock capital of the
bank, and secured by the deposit of bonds of
one-ninth more value than the notes; it being only
allowable to issue nine-tenths of the value of these bonds.
The shareholders were not jointly responsible as in
Scotland and Sweden. When later, in 1872, the
Joint-Stock Bank of the North was formed it desired
to issue notes also, but gave up the idea, as it could
only obtain permission to issue notes for one million
marks and in amounts not less than 100 marks. It
is true that bank-notes in Finland, as in other countries,
hold a less considerable place under the greater
economic development; the deposit of money and the
issue of cheques on deposit holding now a far larger
place in Finland as elsewhere. The notes continue,
however, to be of importance, particularly in the
country, and the profit obtained by their issue is a
great help to the small branch offices in paying their
expenses. To some extent it is true that the notes
lent out create capital; if they are maintained and
the circulation increased by the loans, then and to
that extent they render the same service as gold.
The chief argument on the opposite side is found in
the importance of giving to the privileged national
bank enough power to take care of the national
reserve, which it can better do when it decides the
rate of discount; and the power to decide this is
again given it by its privilege to issue notes. But
the question is whether it is not better that the
elasticity of the circulation and credit of the country
should be in the care of several banks. As a point of
superiority over Sweden, Finlanders dwell on the fact
that from 1886, when the Bank of Finland obtained
the monopoly of note-issue, it was, like the Bank of
England, no longer allowed to pay interest on ordinary
deposits, and that in this manner a division of work is
introduced between the national bank and the private
banks, which the Swedish Riksbank would do well
to imitate.

Undoubtedly Finland’s bank has, on the whole,
contributed to strengthen credit, and it cannot be
denied that in recent times it has understood how
to keep a good national reserve which can render
assistance in periods of difficulty. But the Finnish
economist, Professor J. V. Tallqvist, is probably right
when he reproaches the management of former times
for keeping the rates of discount and interest too low,
contributing by that to develop speculation, and giving
away the Bank’s resources so that it could not assist
when assistance was most needed. The Bank acted in
this manner in the latter half of the seventies, when it
maintained the rates of interest and discount at too
much the same level. We shall return to this point
when we consider the periods of expansion and
restriction in the economic history of the country. As
late as the period 1886-87, it kept too low a rate of
discount and of interest. Professor Tallqvist thinks
that the chief cause of this was the old idea that the
Bank should be conducted in part as a benevolent
institution instead of on business principles. It was
supposed to be for the public benefit that it should
artificially maintain a low rate of interest and of
discount. He thinks that these ideas about assisting
instead of looking at the state of the market, which
formerly hindered the establishment of a real banking
business, were again prominent in the eighties during
the period of economic reaction, when Bismarck
abandoned liberal ideas and the rulers of many other
countries became less inclined to recognise the
importance of free economic activity. In Finland these
ideas caused an increase in the loans given to private
parties from the funds of the State. These loans also,
as we shall see later, increased considerably, while the
reserve of marketable bonds diminished. In recent
times the general policy of the Bank, however, as we
have mentioned, seems to be irreproachable. The
present President of the board of managers in the Bank of
Finland is Herr Theodor Wegelius, who succeeded Herr
Alfred Charpentier, the latter having been made chief
of the Division of Finance of the Senate in 1897.
Both were formerly at the head of private banks.

The new banking law of 1886 formulated rules for
banks receiving deposits or issuing debentures, and did
not permit these to issue obligations payable on demand
to bearer. It is by this prohibition that the issue of
notes is now monopolised by the Bank of Finland.
But it is permissible for banks to issue debentures
for long periods when guaranteed by the deposit of
mortgages or government or municipal bonds under
public control. The legal existence of these banks for
the purpose of issuing such debentures is permitted for
a longer period, and is no more, as formerly, limited to
a period of ten years. A bank which desires such
permission to issue debentures must have a capital of
at least one million marks. For other banks such
a capital is no longer necessary; and smaller banks
are, therefore, found nowadays. Finnish citizens only
can be directors of joint-stock companies and take
part in private banking enterprises with joint
responsibility. The banks are not allowed to place
money in manufacturing or agricultural industries, or
in real estate other than their own building properties.
They must publish monthly statements, and are subject
to public control by a particular commissioner
nominated by the government. If, in addition to the
reserve, a quarter of their capital is lost, they must
close their doors; if one-tenth is lost, the shareholders 
must immediately make it good if they wish
to avoid closing and winding-up.

The “Föreningsbanken i Finland” or Union Bank,
the first private bank in Finland, was formed in
1862. The earliest plan was to form a bank in the
special interest of agriculture; it was to co-operate
with the Hypotheksföreningen, established at the same
time, by placing its debentures, and for this purpose was
always to hold a very considerable amount of the
latter’s paper. It was, however, soon seen that such
a special purpose was not in the interest of the bank
and the shareholders; it might amount to a
compulsory tying up of capital in an unremunerative
manner. This idea was, therefore, soon given up.
The bank was at first managed by the late Henrik
Borgström, its main promoter and initiator, and after
his early death, by the late August Törnqvist; and
later by Baron J. Cronstedt as manager-in-chief and
ex-Senator L. Mechelin as president of the board of
directors. It has been extremely successful. During
the period 1877-79 it paid a dividend of 15 per
cent.; from 1880 to 1882 the dividend varied from
17 to 19 per cent.; since 1884 it has paid 20 per
cent., and in later years still more, in 1900 the
dividend being 24 per cent. It has at the same
time been able to form a considerable reserve.
When in 1896 it decided to increase its capital of
3 million marks by another million, it was able to
issue the stock at 400, while 128 is the price of
the paid-up capital with the addition of reserve, so
that by this issue it could increase its reserve by
another 3 million marks. It has now 4 million
marks share capital and 8,700,000 marks reserve. The
lowest recent quotation of the stock is 500, at which
price it returns a little over 4 per cent. The turnover
of the bank last year was about 2,600 million marks,
and its deposits 88 million. Its expenses have in
later years been about 40 per cent, of the gross profit.

The Joint-Stock Bank of the North for Commerce
and Manufacture (Nordiska Aktiebanken för Handel
och Industri) was established in the speculative year
of 1872; and one of the objects of this bank, whose
headquarters are in Viborg, adjacent to St. Petersburg,
and whose basis was to be the metallic monetary
system in Finland, was that it should also operate in
Russia, where the local banks were still confronted
with the difficulty of irredeemable notes. The bank
was meant also to act as a Credit Mobilier or
Industrial Company; that is, to take part in establishing
new enterprises; and it was largely for this purpose
that out of 12 million marks paid-up capital, or 40
per cent. of the nominal share capital of 30
millions, a sum of 7 millions was used at once to finance a
branch office in St. Petersburg. The banking houses
which promoted the bank, of which the Seligmanns
in Frankfort was the best known, reserved for
themselves an important privilege as to the issue of new
stock. As the speculative period after the Franco-German 
war was, however, followed by the crisis of
1873, the capital was decreased to the already
paid-up 12 millions, and the stock was also offered for
subscription in Finland at 102½. In 1876 the
capital was further put down to 8 millions, and
2 millions were written off as loss in Russia. This
bank also, with Herr Eugen Wolff as chairman of
the board of directors and Herr W. Burjam and Herr
Felix Heikel as chief managers, has lately been very
successful. It was able in 1896 to increase its
capital by half a million marks issued at 190, and
in 1898 by 1½ million issued at 200; so that, having
paid out of the profit of the issue 450,000 marks
to the banking houses of Seligmann and Stettheimer,
it could increase its reserve to a total of 3½ millions.
The dividend on its 10 million marks of share capital
has during seven years averaged more than 9 per cent.,
which in later years has been a little less than 4 per
cent. on the price of the stock. Its expenses have
been less than 40 per cent. of the gross profit.

Among other banks, the Bank of Vasa was
established in 1879, with object of taking over the
main part of the banking business in Ostrobothnia;
but as the other banks would not give up their
branch offices in this part of the country, it also
established branches elsewhere. It was able to 
increase its capital of 1½ million by the issue in
1896 of another million at 170; 145 would have
been the price at par, reckoning the capital with
the additional reserve. It has now a share capital
of 3 millions with a reserve of 1,850,000. It has
in later years paid 9 per cent. in dividends. Its
expenses have varied considerably. The Bank of
Nyland was established in 1887 with only 300,000
marks capital, but in 1890 and 1895 it increased
its capital by 300,000 and 400,000 marks issued
at 125 and 132; the last issue was at par, reckoning
the capital with the additional reserve. It has now
1 million capital and 300,000 marks reserve, the
average dividend being 5 per cent.; and the expenses
being 39 per cent. of the gross profit. The
Folkbank, which it was decided to establish at about the
same time, and which tried to attract depositors by
giving part of the profit to those who deposited on
Savings Bank terms, has increased its capital of
300,000 to 700,000 by the issue of new stock
at 103, but in consequence of losses in 1896 it
transferred its business to the new Privatbank of
Helsingfors with a capital of 2 millions. This bank,
too, with Herr E. Schybergson as manager, has been
able to issue new stock at 160, increasing thereby
the share-capital to 4 millions with one million reserve.
The dividend in 1900 was 10 per cent. The Kansallis
Osake Pankki (the Finnish name for the “National
Joint-Stock Bank”), with Professor Alfred Kihlman as
chairman of the board of directors and Herr F. K.
Nybom as manager-in-chief, was established in 1890
in Helsingfors with 2½ million capital, one quarter
being paid up; later, in 1891, it was able to issue
1½ million more of stock at 106, and in 1898 one
million at 106, so that it has now a capital of 5
million marks and a reserve of about 1½ million marks.
Its expenses have been 39 per cent. of the gross profit.
It has 27 branch offices, and holds more ordinary
deposits than any other bank. During the last few
years it has paid a dividend of 9 per cent. The
Joint-Stock Bank of Åbo with Herr E. Dahlström
as chairman of the board of directors and Herr J.
O. Wasastjerna as manager, and the Joint-Stock Bank
of Tammerfors with Herr E. Borenius as manager, each
with 3 million marks’ capital, are new institutions.
The Maanviljelys-jateollisuus pankki (Bank of
Agriculture and Manufactures), established in 1898 with
a capital of 3 million marks, and a reserve of 300,000,
is the only bank which has not been successful, and
it has therefore, according to the banking law, been
obliged to close its doors. Connected with it was
the small bank of Nykarleby.

In order to give a more complete idea of the
business done we will give in round figures, representing
millions of marks, the most important items from the
statement of the banks.

Among later changes up to the end of June 1901
may be mentioned an increase in the discounting of bills
on Finland to 39 millions, in foreign bills to 10 millions,
and loans to 16 millions; an increase natural in a
period when several private banks were obliged to
decrease their business. The reserve has at the same
time been increased considerably, but is now being used
largely to increase the capital to 25 millions, while
the reserve itself is to be brought up to 15 millions.

Since the end of 1899 the discount and loans have
increased, but, latterly, also the deposits; and the less
favourable situation and decrease in business, such as
has also occurred in other countries, seems again about
to give place to a more favourable situation. The
balance of the banks, of private banks as well as that
of the Bank of Finland, makes on the whole a very
favourable impression. It will be noticed that it is
especially credit in readily-liquidated form, particularly
bills of exchange, which has increased. Also cash
credit has increased considerably. At the same time
the period of the running of bills and loans has
decreased. The expenses of the banks are on an
average under 1 per cent. of the whole amount to the
credit of the bank, and under 1 per thousand of the
turnover; and, as we have already mentioned in
speaking of the large banks, they represent about 40
per cent. of the gross profit. As we also mentioned
in connection with the private banks, the great
increase in the capital of the banks has taken place in
latter years. It was during the period 1896-98 that
this increased by 22 millions to a total of 36 millions
of capital and 17 millions of reserve. The business
of the private banks, which are comparatively new
institutions, has increased more rapidly than that of
the Bank of Finland.

Concerning these banks, as well as other departments
of the economic life of the country, it is of interest to
examine the periods of expansion and restriction,
which return, especially in the larger countries, with
a certain regularity every ten or eleven years. There
is never perfect regularity; peculiar causes always
exercise a considerable influence, not the least in small
countries with an unusual situation. In Finland, the
consequences of the frequent failures of the harvest are
necessarily widely felt, as is, on the other hand, any
increase in the demand for wood in foreign countries.
Lumber and other forms of wood follow to an unusual
extent the general expanding and contracting
movements of the great markets. But this is not always
so; and, as in the case of iron, there is also a
considerable demand for wood during the early days of a
period of depression. Constructive work is going on;
contracts have been made; it takes time before
business can be stopped. On the other hand, the
pre-arranged transport of wood to the markets cannot be
stopped, since it takes in some cases four years from
the moment of cutting down the trees in the forests.
Among other disturbing causes in Finland must be
remembered the two monetary changes from irredeemable 
notes to silver, and from silver to gold, which
were especially disturbing, because long periods were
allowed to elapse before the changes decided on were
carried out.

The period of the sixties has been spoken of in
connection with the difficulties caused by the
introduction of the silver standard, and we have explained
how this transformation of the monetary system
coincided with severe famines, as well as with the universal
crisis of 1864, which culminated in a panic in London
on “Black Friday” in 1866, when Overend & Gurney
failed. The situation in Finland became peculiarly
difficult, because the government delayed the carrying
out of promised monetary reform, and thereby
uncertainty was created; this being especially the case
at the beginning of 1865. The Bank of Finland’s
total loans decreased between the end of 1863 and
the end of 1865 from 25 to less than 20 million
marks, and in October 1866 to 18 million marks;
while in 1865 even the Union Bank was obliged to
restrict its discounts by about 2 million marks.
The note circulation of the Bank of Finland decreased
between October 1865 and July 1866 from 26 to 20
millions. In 1866 the country is said to have gone
through the severest crisis it has ever known. Then
and in the next period all forms of banking business
decreased, note circulation, deposits, loans and
discounts, current accounts and cash credit. The import,
which in 1865 amounted to 72 millions, was in 1866
only 56 millions; the export went down from 40 to
31 millions. It was not till 1869 that the import
again rose above the total of 1865, to 76 millions;
the export had increased considerably by 1867. In
1869 the harvest was better, and the whole situation
was ameliorated, but commerce again decreased between
1869 and 1870. The bills held in the Bank of
Finland decreased from a maximum in 1862 to a minimum
in 1870; but when the total amount of the loans
between 1867 and 1871 decreased from 36½ to 29½,
this decrease, especially for the last year, can only be
said to have been formally announced; the Bank
recognised then in its accounts considerable losses, which
were really incurred earlier.

Finland profited considerably by the general
expansion of business in the period following the
Franco-German war. The export of lumber brought much
money into the country, even after the general crisis
had taken place in 1873. The whole export of wood
increased between 1870 and 1877 from 13 to 59
million marks. All kinds of business expanded. The
bank deposits increased between 1869 and 1876 from
18 to 34½ millions; the banks’ bills on Finland between
1870 and 1876 from 11 to 76 millions. At the end
of 1872 there were fewer foreign bills, but in the
following years, when most other countries suffered
from the general monetary crisis, business in Finland
continued to progress. In the years 1873-74 loans
under divers forms increased in the Bank of Finland
by 30 per cent., and in the Union Bank by 28 per
cent.; again in 1875 in the Bank of Finland by 43
per cent., but in the Union Bank in that year only by
8 per cent. We mention these figures because Professor 
Tallqvist is probably right in reproaching the
Bank of Finland with too low a rate of interest and
discount. This was increased by the Union Bank in
the spring of 1875 to 5 and 5½ per cent., besides the
commission of 1 and 2 per cent, paid on all discounts;
but it was only in the beginning of 1876 that the
Bank of Finland increased its low 4 per cent. rate by
½ per cent. It was therefore only natural that, unlike
the other banks, its discounts continued to increase in
1876-77, and its loans on deposited securities even in
1878. Felix Heikel quotes the common saying that
the Bank of Finland now accepted the lemons squeezed
by the other banks.

Already, in 1875, lumber had gone down and the
freights were also low. There was no general crisis,
but the failure of the Bank of Glasgow had a certain
influence on the general market. In 1877, during
the Russo-Turkish war, lumber again went down, and
commerce, particularly exports to Russia, suffered from
the great decrease in the value of the rouble. The
adoption of the gold standard in Finland in 1877 took
place with less delay than the introduction of the
silver standard in the sixties, though only after a
considerable fall in silver and considerable fluctuation in
the ratio to gold: changes which were greatly to the
disadvantage of debtors. The Bank of Finland was
obliged to preserve a sufficient reserve of gold, and
having for a while continued an over-liberal increase
of its bills and loans, it was now obliged to restrict its
business. Its loans, under divers forms, decreased in
the period 1877-80 from 28 to 17 millions; while the
holding of bills in all the banks in the period 1876-79
decreased from 36 to 26½ millions; loans on deposited
securities in the period 1877-80 from 22¾ to 15½
millions; and the total of loans in the period 1877-80
from 65½ to below 49 millions. Here as elsewhere it
was noted that the discounting of bills decreased first;
at the beginning of the bad time customers were ready
to produce deposits for their loans. On the other
hand, when the good times began again, loans on bills
or personal credit were the first to be extended. As a
consequence of the bad times and a poor sale, loans on
merchandise, especially on deals and boards, at once
rose to a rather considerable extent, decreasing again
rapidly to a minimum in the following years. The
banks’ foreign bills, as well as their credit with their
correspondents, decreased in the period 1873—78 from
30 to 8 millions; in the Bank of Finland they went
down during the period 1874—78 from 24 to less than
6 millions; and if to this is added the decrease of its
foreign saleable securities, from about 26 to about
9 millions, there appears here a total decrease in
resources from 50 to 15 millions. Notwithstanding
the formation of the gold reserve, the ready money
did not increase, but decreased by some millions. In
1878, with a bad harvest, the real financial crisis
developed.

As a consequence of this situation and of the
liquidation which had already taken place, the general
crisis of 1882-84, which raged in the United States,
and was marked by the collapse of the Union Générale
in France, was less felt in Finland. The prices and
export of lumber had been good in 1880 and 1882,
but were poor in 1883, in consequence of this general
crisis. Also other export to Russia was bad. The
sinking of the value of the rouble brought a
momentary profit to Russian exporters, but was a great
disadvantage to all importers. In 1882 the import to
Finland had been as high as 167 millions, the export
as high as 120 millions; they fell in the following
years to 90 millions for the import in 1886, and
77 millions for the export in 1887. The bank
statements reflect the situation. The holding of foreign
exchange and the amounts of foreign current accounts
decreased in the period 1880-82 from 38½ to 21½
millions, and again in 1883-84 from about 27 to
under 26 millions, and in the Bank of Finland in the
period 1883-86 from 18 to 12 millions. On the
whole, the Bank of Finland maintained a careful
policy during this period; losses occurred in 1883
in two other banks, but not in the national bank.
There was another partial decrease of business in the
next few years, but 1887 was again a year of
expansion. On the whole, the bank business progressed
during this period, the total loans, for instance, in
1885-87 rising from less than 69 to over 80 millions.
The Union Bank and the Joint-Stock Bank of the
North wisely decreased their deposit interest. The
Bank of Finland had restricted its loans in 1886, but
surpassed the others now by its low rate of interest
and discount, and at the same time established a
considerable number of branch offices, with the result
that its loans increased in 1886-87 from 21 to 87
millions. The trouble was, according to Professor
Tallqvist, that leading men in the Diet had now
adopted the German “social-politische” idea that
industry and workers ought to be artificially assisted
from above, notably by an artificially low rate of
interest. Government loans of 17,600,000 marks in
1886 and of 40 million marks in 1889 contributed to
develop a speculative activity. Loans from government
funds increased during the period 1887-90 from 19½ to
27 millions, while the funds sold part of their
securities. The years 1888—90 were also a period
remarkable for the formation of new joint-stock companies,
which were floated to the value of about 24 million
marks, 16 millions being subscribed in Helsingfors
and its vicinity alone. A large amount of building
work was also going on at Helsingfors. The total
bank loans were doubled during the period 1887-90,
rising from 71½ to 137 millions. It was not only
bad Russian money which created commercial
difficulties, but also the new and increased duties on
imports into Russia imposed in 1888.

At the end of 1890 the Baring crisis in London
developed into a universal crisis, which at last in 1893
devastated Australia and the United States. As on
several previous occasions, it was not at the moment
of the great crisis in the world’s markets, but rather
later, that Finland suffered. In this case it was not
before the end of 1891 and the following years.
Lumber had gone down, and the export was bad in
1890, decreasing in 1889-90 from 44 million to
below 34 million marks; but it was as much, or
more, the poor harvest in Finland in 1891-92 which
caused great difficulties. The import in 1891 was
146 millions, the export 104 millions; the import
went down to 126 millions in 1893, the export to
94 millions in 1892, but increased again in 1893 to
115 millions. The rate of discount in 1890 was 3½,
and the Bank of Finland rate was put up then by
only one-half; but at the end of 1891 it went up to
5½ and 6; and at the same time the Bank was obliged
to borrow from the government 5 million marks,
requiring also in the following year government 
assistance in order to obtain a foreign credit of 10 millions.
Such a foreign credit for the national bank, guaranteed
by the government, is, however, provided for and
approved by the Diet. Business was then suffering
because of a bad harvest in Russia, and on account
of the prohibition of the export of oats from Finland
to other countries; also from the stoppage of traffic
due to fear of the cholera, and finally from the tariff
war between Russia and Germany, which had provoked
in St. Petersburg an order to increase the Finnish duty
by 50 per cent. Business failures were in 1889 only
155; in 1891 they were 285; in 1892 they had
risen to 448; in 1893 they were 413. The speculative 
building going on in Helsingfors suffered especially. 
We have already had occasion, when speaking
of manufactures and commerce as well as of other
matters, to show the results of bad times by various
statistics. As is usually the case, the banks profited
little by the great demand for money. In 1889-90
they had paid on an average 11.6 per cent. in
dividends. In 1891 there was a high rate of
interest for loans, but also for deposits, and their
dividend was only 8 per cent.; in 1892 it was 7 per
cent.; in 1896, 6.2; in 1894 the rate of interest for
deposit was decreased from 5 to 4 and 3½ per cent.,
and the dividends in the three following years were
about 7 per cent. Some part of this result was due
to the greater competition between the now numerous
banks.

The depression of trade in the early part of the
nineties, in Finland as in other countries, was soon
followed by a great increase. The business of the
private banks was now especially extended, their
deposits increasing between 1890 and 1894 from 89 to
132 millions, and their loans from 98 to 146 millions.
The monetary situation improved further in 1895,
when the government borrowed 19 millions at 3½
per cent., while 20 millions were borrowed by the
Hypothekskassa and the Mortgage Department of the
Union Bank. These increased resources assisted the
new progress. A large number of new joint-stock
companies were now formed. In 1896, besides new
banks, ninety new companies were formed with a
capital of 9½ millions, making altogether, if we add the
increased capital of old companies, 11½ millions of new
capital. In 1897, ninety-seven companies with 16
millions of capital were formed, or, with the increased
capital of older companies, 20 millions extra capital.
In 1898, 201 companies were formed with 31½ millions
of capital, making, with the increased capital of older
companies, a total of 35½ millions of extra capital
subscribed. This is without calculating the loans of new
companies from the banks or their issue of bonds. In
1881, 2½ millions were borrowed on stock in the banks;
in 1893, 11½ millions; in 1898, 34½ millions. Bank
business was progressing rapidly; but while in 1891
loans and deposits balanced one another, being 110
millions on each side, it was the deposits which first
increased; in 1894 these being 146 millions against
122½ millions of loans, an excess of 23½ millions; in
1895 the deposits were 204 millions against loans
163 millions, excess 41 millions; in 1897 deposits
288 millions and loans 264 millions, excess 24
millions; and at the end of 1898, when the figures
had trebled from 1891, they were, deposits 319
millions and loans 330 millions, the excess of loans
representing about 12 millions. At the end of 1899
there were only 306½ million marks of deposits against
356 millions of loans, or an excess of over 49 millions;
at the end of June 1900 the deposits were 313½
millions against loans 385 millions, or excess of loans
71½; the deposits had at the end of May gone down
to 309; later the loans decreased, deposits increased.
At the end of June 1901 the deposits were 319
millions, the loans 336 millions, an excess of only
17 millions, reckoned, as usual, beyond foreign
exchange and government deposits in the Bank of
Finland.

Generally the business of the world has somewhat
decreased since the second quarter of 1900, when the
prices of iron and steel first broke in the United
States, and also when the average prices, as they are
calculated in the so-called index numbers in the large
countries, showed a small decrease. The reaction
became still more pronounced in 1901. In some
countries there had been a critical situation even
earlier, as for instance in some of the countries of the
Balkan Peninsula and in Russia and Poland; in Russia
the crisis continued longer and was sharper than in
any other country. The progress had been very
pronounced in the Scandinavian countries and Finland
and therefore it was only natural that the reaction
there should begin comparatively early; and,
moreover, this early reaction seems a guarantee against
later disturbances. There are evidently no such
difficulties as, for instance, in Germany, where the
expansion has been more considerable. The periodical
variation of prices seems to be inevitable; sentiments
and opinions which influence prices and credit vary in
a general way; and men move in crowds. But there
does not seem to be any absolute necessity for violent
crises. It is during these crises that the efforts and
policy of the banks exercise enormous influence, and it
is satisfactory to notice that all of them, especially the
leading banks, have evidently learned by experience.
They are well prepared for the disturbances which can
hardly be avoided when the general economic tide is
turning and prices are declining. The South African
war has probably decreased the speculative tendency
in England, so that there is less chance of a crisis.
The United States are the field of an extraordinary
expansion, but they are also developing a corresponding 
strength. In Germany the wise chiefs of the national
bank have provided as far as possible for the reaction.
The Bank of France is stronger than it has been at any
previous period, its task being easier because of the
small tendency to speculative enterprise in the French
nation. Among the smaller nations, Holland has, as
usual, so acted that it cannot easily get into difficulties,
while Belgium with its great enterprise, and also
Switzerland, have naturally utilised the strong
neighbouring market of France. The leaders of Finland’s
finance seem to have acted with great circumspection.
That the private banks should re-discount and borrow
on securities in the Bank of Finland is only natural;
they have not done this to any very great extent, not
much more than a total of 10 millions; and in the
summer of 1901 the amounts were decreasing. On
the whole they seem to have maintained their strength;
and, what is more important, this has evidently been
done quite satisfactorily by the Bank of Finland.
Also the Bank has increased the total amount of its
loans during the period 1895-99 from 31 to 51
millions, and later by still larger amounts; but, like
the Scandinavian banks, it has increased its rate of
discount and interest in time, and has therefore been
able to preserve such resources as foreign bills, credit
in other countries, and saleable bonds. At the end of
1899 it obtained a provisional loan of 7 millions from
the government, and we have explained how the Diet
has wisely increased its capital from 10 to 25 millions
by means of earned profit, while at the same time it
holds a reserve of 15 millions, and how it has finally
increased its right of note-issue from 35 to 40 millions
without special covering, while at the same time it
allows foreign bills to be included in the legal covering
for notes, which represents a monetary increase of
another 5 millions. Several other countries have recently
adopted similar measures. It is an equally wise policy
that silver, except coins, should no longer be regarded
as cash. Some of the large countries which have
gathered enormous masses of silver as reserves for their
banks, reckoning it at a nominal value, which is often
double that of the real value, have only a fictitious
reserve. In all countries the government is closely
connected with the leading banks, and it is therefore
not without interest to notice the situation of the
Treasury. The Finnish government has in three years
decreased the amount of its credit in other countries
by a few millions, the decrease being from 11 to 7
millions. Herr Theodore Wegelius reckoned that in
the same three years, up to the autumn of 1900,
several institutions sold foreign bonds to the value of
about 9 million marks. In the same period 53 millions
had to be reckoned to the credit of the country, the
result of foreign borrowing, besides some conversions,
some municipal loans, and loans made by the
Hypothekskassa (or Mortgage Bank) and the Joint-Stock 
Bank of the North. Finally the government
itself borrowed 25 millions as part of the expenses of
the construction of railroads, to be spread over four
years. All such transactions have to be considered on
their merits. They are only a part of the whole mass
of transactions forming an international balance: they
are commendable if they pay, not because of their
influence on the international balance, which corrects
itself.

An important place in the banking system of
Finland is held by the Hypotheksföreningen i Finland,
established in i860, and now under the management
of Colonel Kasten Antell, who is also chairman of the
board of directors. It is an association of property-holders, 
who are jointly responsible in the same manner
as such associations in northern Germany, as the
Prussian Landschaften, for instance, or as the associations
of property-holders in Denmark and in Sweden. At
the end of 1900 it had provided about 4700 loans,
of the total value of 40 million marks, of which
34 millions were still outstanding. It has obtained
money by the issue of debentures which, with the
exception of a few millions issued in Finland, are all
placed on the great markets, especially in Germany,
at first at 4½ per cent., later at 4 per cent., and lastly
at 3½ per cent. It owns now a reserve of 1¼ million.
It is controlled by the government, and the State of
Finland has until now guaranteed its foreign loans.
The borrowers pay at present for the first loans 5¾ per
cent. and for the later loans per cent., including
interest and amortisation and expenses. Instead of
increasing the interest, when, as at present, the general
rate of interest has gone up, the association has
preferred to let new borrowers pay a rebate on the loans
which they receive, which rebate has been increased of
late from 2½ to 4 per cent., and to let the decrease
which was decided on a few years ago (a quarter
per cent. on the yearly interest to be paid by all
debtors) continue. During recent years losses and
non-payment of interest for longer periods have been
entirely unknown. The loans are secured on half of
the valuation. There are complaints, however, because
the association does not lend on property valued at
less than 6000 marks, and even this limit has only
recently been conceded after some resistance from the
Senate, instead of the former limit of 8000 marks.
There is a fear that the property of the settlers in the
northern part of the country, where land is as easily
obtainable as in the uncolonised districts of the United
States, and also as easily given up, might not be
sufficiently good security. The managers and directors
have declared that according to their experience it is
possible to fix a lower limit without any risk whatever.

The Mortgage Bank for the towns, Städernas i
Finland Hypothekskassa, was established in 1895, and
has now a share capital of 3 million marks, with a
reserve of about one-third of a million. It is a bank
where, unlike the Hypotheksföreningen, there is no
joint responsibility on the part of the borrowers.
Professor A. Kihlman is the chairman; and, in succession
to Herr Aug. Ramsay, who was appointed chief of the
Division of Commerce and Industry in the Senate, it
has as manager ex-Senator Serlachius. At the end of
1900 it had issued bonds for a total amount of 30½
millions, bearing interest at 4 per cent., the price being
99. The mass of its loans are for long periods on
amortisation and are not granted on more than
one-half of the value. Most of them, 26½ millions in all,
are held in Helsingfors. It has recently paid to the
shareholders a 6 per cent. dividend.

The above-mentioned law of 1886, which permits
the banks to issue bonds or debentures on security of
mortgages or bonds of governments and of
municipalities and under government control, had at the
end of 1899 been taken advantage of by the Union
Bank and the Joint-Stock Bank of the North, the
total of their issues being 23 millions.

Finland has not yet any Exchange. There are only
periodical sales of securities. It must not be forgotten
how new this whole development is. More frequent
sales of securities are wanted.

The savings banks have also made progress, although
by no means to the same extent as the banks. They
are established either by private people or
municipalities and communes, and by the law of 1895 are
subject to the control of a savings-bank inspector. In
1880 they numbered 109, with 36,000 accounts and a
capital of 14½ millions. At the end of 1899 there were
188 savings banks, with 133,000 books, and 72 million
deposits. The average in 1880 was 396 marks per
book; in 1899 it was 542 marks. In the country the
deposits amount to 20¼ millions: in the cities to 51½
millions. The deposits were less in number and of less
amount in the so-called Old Finland, formerly the
Russian part, and were greatest in the south-western
part of the country, where the savings bank of Åbo,
for instance, established in 1823, has 15 million marks
of deposits. In one single härad one out of every nine
persons has money deposited in the savings bank; for
the whole country the number is one in twenty. The
savings bank of Helsingfors has 8½ million marks of
deposits. The reserve of all the savings banks amounts
to 8¾ millions, or 12 per cent. of the deposits. Half
the capital is lent out on mortgage on real estate, 34
per cent. against other guarantees, 11 per cent. deposited
in the banks or placed in saleable bonds, and 2 per
cent. held as cash. Interest varies from 5.45 per cent.
paid by borrowers in Nyland, to 5.97 paid in the
distant Kuopio. In one year, 1899, the average
interest over the whole country increased from 5.56 to
5.68. The interest paid to the depositors was
increased from 4.39 to 4.60, less than the average
increase in the rate of interest for the same time. The
amount of the deposits increased in 1898 by 13 per
cent.; in 1899, when the general progress was less, by
5⅓ per cent. It increased most in those districts where
the highest interest is paid by the savings banks, the
increase being as much as 20 per cent. where the bank
paid 5 per cent.; but it was 39½ per cent. at the same
savings banks in 1898, and about 50 per cent. in 1897.
Where interest is low there is a natural preference for
depositing money in the common banks. The
post-office savings banks, which were introduced in 1886,
are comparatively little used; at the end of 1899 they
contained 2½ million deposits, against 1½ million in
1898, and 1 million at the end of 1897.

A peculiarly Finnish institution are the warehouses
which it has been found necessary to establish in a
great number of parishes to supply the people with
grain during the winter and the spring. Their
existence in about 400 parishes dates from a
decision of the Swedish Diet in 1756, At the end of
1898, according to their books, they held 364,000
hectolitres of rye, 225,000 hectolitres of barley, and
260,000 hectolitres of oats, of which two-thirds at that
time were in the warehouses and one-third lent out.
They had a reserve of cash of about three-quarters of
a million marks, and the total capital of these
institutions, including funds formed by their means, was
about 7 million marks.

Insurance in Finland is arranged on the same lines
as in other countries which are in the same stage of
civilisation. Foreign companies, especially Swedish,
carry on business by the side of the Finnish
companies; and some of the Finnish companies do
business in other countries, though to a less extent.
For some time they seemed to succeed, but of late
the political situation has lessened their credit in
other countries.

Among the fire insurance companies the Fennia has
4 millions share capital and three-quarters of a million
reserve, and the Pohjola has 5 millions capital and a
quarter of a million reserve. At the end of 1898 the
latter had 418 million marks’ worth of insurances, of
which 317 millions were in Finland. To this must be
added estimated insurances of foreign companies worth
220 millions (Swedish companies over 151, English
over 68), making a total of 537 millions. The
amount of insurance during the year 1900 increased
by 76 millions. Russian insurance companies,
unlike Finnish and other foreign companies, are not
obliged to issue any report. The amount of their
insurance policies is calculated at 170 millions. This
gives a grand total of 707 millions. Among the
mutual benefit societies, the Society of the Country
has 114 millions in policies. The Society of the
Cities, with Dr. Axel Lille as manager, has 302
millions. There are several other considerable
associations for the provinces, for the saw-mill owners, for
country merchants, for personal estate (which latter
has policies to the value of 55 millions), the total
policies being worth 620 millions. Detailed reports
exist of the old insurance policies in the hundreds and
the parishes, where the premiums were a kind of tax
to be paid when the householder was not insured
elsewhere. They were estimated at 350 millions. The
grand total for all fire insurance is calculated at 1676
million marks.

A new Finnish company, the Osmo, with a capital of
half a million marks, does business in reinsurance.

For insurance of transport and maritime insurance
there exist two Finnish companies, the best known
being the Sea Insurance Company, with Herr Uno
Kurtén as manager, and a capital of 2 million marks;
and two mutual associations; but the largest business
in this department is done by foreigners. A small
Finnish company insures glass, and two Finnish
companies insure horses and cattle. The one in Åbo for
the insurance of horses has 3½ million marks of
policies, and there is a general company for Finland
with 4½ million policies. Foreign companies insure
against theft.

With regard to insurance against personal accidents,
we have already mentioned the new law of 1895,
enforcing a general insurance of workmen for this
purpose. There are two Finnish companies for
voluntary insurance; the Patria, whose manager is Herr
Axel Lille, and the Kullervo, each with half a million
marks of capital, besides reserves. There are also
three Russian and one Swiss company doing business.
The six mutual assurance societies formed by various
manufacturers have fewer expenses than the public
companies, their cost varying from 4 to 13 per cent.,
the smaller cost attaching to the association of
the saw-mill owners, which is the largest society.
The expenses of the companies vary from 22½ per
cent. in the Patria to 28½ per cent. in the
Internationale Unfalls-Versicherungsgesellschaft. At the
end of 1899 about a thousand firms had insured
50,000 workmen against accidents incapacitating them
for long periods and against death, and 17,000
workmen against minor accidents.

Among life insurance companies two are Finnish
companies; the Kaleva, whose manager is Herr Uno
Kurtén, and the Suomi, whose manager is Herr E.
Kaslin, with 2 millions and half a million capital
respectively, besides reserves. In 1899 they had 114
million marks’ worth of insurance policies in Finland,
and 120 millions in other countries. Their insurance
fund was 17 million marks, and their books show a
decrease in business in other countries. The total
amount of insurance policies in Finland in 1895 was
worth 105 million marks. The Finnish companies
have 56 per cent. of the business; and nineteen
foreign, mainly Swedish, companies have the balance
of the reported business between them. The Russian
companies are here, too, not bound to furnish reports.
The life insurance was only 78 marks per head of the
total population, and only 40,000 persons were
insured; that is to say, it is still only the middle-class
who insure their lives. The amounts per head are,
however, decreasing, which shows that life insurance is
becoming more popular. Life insurance is controlled
by a Government Inspector, but no such supervision is
yet introduced for fire insurance. Altogether, insurance 
business is increasing, although not yet so well
developed as is the banking system.

<chapter name="IX. Means of Communication">

<h2><small>CHAPTER IX</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>MEANS OF COMMUNICATION</small></small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> oldest means of communication in Finland and
other parts of Western Europe are the waterways;
in Finland, not only the sea with its broken-up coasts,
giving communication with the great world, but also
the lakes and rivers in the interior. The character of
this country, “the last-born daughter of the sea,” with
its great lake-systems in the interior, and the land
only sloping down near the coast, has made it possible
for these great inland seas to be utilised for navigation.
It was along the waterways that communication first
took place; and these are still to-day the great means
of communication everywhere, especially in the north
during the summer, when there is no winter snow for
the sleighs. In the far north they are still the only
routes existing, and it is over them that a considerable
part of the people travel to the large fisheries on the
coasts of the Polar Sea and the White Sea. In the
south, too, boats and small steamers ply everywhere,
among the islands of the coast as well as on the large
inland lakes, which have the same character as the
coasts, and afford excellent means of communication
during the summer.

The great hindrance to navigation was formerly the
rapids, to which we have referred, and which are very
numerous in many of the rivers. The people, however,
soon learned to overcome this difficulty; places were
found where the boats could be drawn overland, and
experience taught the art of travelling on streams
where it was dangerous for less expert men to sail.
To-day the navigation here is of great importance,
especially in the north; and the tar boats, which are
the main means of communication on the Uleå, are
one example of this river-communication. These with
their sworn pilots continue to be the regular means
of communication, and for strangers it is a great
attraction to travel in this novel manner.

Work was undertaken in early days to overcome
the difficulties on the streams; and in modern times
the great canals have been among the most important
means of opening up the country and increasing the
value of the forest and land. The present increase of
communication on these lakes gives some idea of the
importance of the work. The Saima lake district, in
which the waterfalls on the Vuoksi formerly hindered
all access from the sea, is the largest of its kind in
Europe, covering 64,000 square kilometres, or one-sixth
of the whole of Finland, in a district where one-fifth of
the population live. Ships from other countries can
now penetrate by these lakes 400 kilometres into the
country. The two other lake-systems farther to the west,
the Päijänne and Näsijärvi, have not the same area,
but are of importance. At the end of the fifteenth
century, Erik Thureson Bjelke, who commanded the
forts of Viborg on the sea, and of Nyslott between
the lakes, tried to open an outlet here. The idea was
taken up a century later by General Pontus de la
Gardie, a French emigre, and some years later by
Charles XI. It has now been carried through under
the direction of the Swedish Lieutenant-Colonel Baron
Nils Ericsson, brother to the well-known inventor and
engineer, John Ericsson, who designed the <i>Monitor</i> and
invented the screw. At a cost of 12⅓ million marks
a canal was built from Lake Saima to Viborg in
1844-56, with twenty-eight locks, and a total length
of 59 kilometres, of which 32 have been dug out
of the earth. The canal is now used by more than
5,000 ships every year, and once yielded a revenue of
500,000 marks a year; but after the tariff had been
decreased in 1893 the revenue fell to about 300,000
marks. Some time earlier, water-routes 300
kilometres long were established on the Saima system
from Villmanstrand in the south to Iisalmi in the
north. About 3¾ million marks have been spent on
canal works in the interior; and finally 2 million
marks on making a canal from Nyslott to the
northeast, and from the Pielis, the outlet from the great
Pielisjärvi lake-system. In other places half a million
marks have been expended, and another 300,000 on
the Vuoksi itself. In all, 19 millions have been spent
on the Saima system. Later, work has been done at
Paijfinne, and in the interior of Savolaks and at the
outlet of the Kymmene, the cost of this being one-third
of a million; and finally, half a million has been spent
on the Näsijärvi system and over half a million on the
rivers of Ostrobothnia, including some work on the
Uleå River. The total amount expended on canals is
about 25 million marks.

In former times most of the lumber was exported
from Ostrobothnia, and when the export became
considerable the greater part of the wood was gathered
together on the lake-systems of Näsijärvi and Saima
to be exported, in one case <i>viâ</i> Björneborg at the
mouth of the river Kumo, which is the outlet for the
Näsijärvi lake-system, and from Saima (when the
Saima Canal was finished in 1856) it was taken <i>viâ</i>
Viborg. In the years 1865-69 more than 38 per
cent. of the total export took place over Viborg, and
about 14 per cent. over Björneborg. It was only in
the seventies that floating began on the Päijänne and
its outlet, the Kymmene; and it was at this time
that Kotka became a town and soon afterwards the
leading export place for timber. In 1877 a
custom-house was established, but already in 1880 Kotka
exported more than Björneborg, and in 1881 more
than Viborg. In 1894 Kotka exported 20 per cent.
of the timber, Viborg 17 per cent., and Björneborg,
which had advanced to 19 in the latter part of the
seventies, fell again to 14 per cent. The fourth place
is now held by Åbo. On the whole, it is still from
Southern Finland that the great export comes. The
North has the greatest mass of forests, but has only
recently begun to take any considerable share in the
timber trade.

Floating on the great water-courses is the chief
method of timber transport. On the Kymmene and
Kumo Rivers alone more than 4 million logs per year
are now floated. The associations of the saw-mill
owners have accomplished much; among other things,
they have expended about 900,000 marks on the
Kymmene. The result is that it now costs 13 penni
per log instead of 47 penni, as in 1877, to carry the logs
from Päijänne to Kotka; while on the Kumo the cost
is 38-45 penni per log from the rolling trams at
Tammerfors out to Björneborg. At Viborg only 3
to 4 per cent. of the lumber from the Saima system is
sawn; the mass is dealt with on mills at the lakes and
carried by railroad or on boats through the canal; but
in the interior considerable masses are floated out
to the larger lakes. For instance about 1 million
logs and 600,000 pieces for the pulp mills are floated
through the Laitasalmi at Nyslott, and it costs now
only 30-40 penni from Joensuu to Villmanstrand
instead of double, as formerly. In the east, too, the
floating is important, as, for instance, on the Jänisjärvi
water-course to Ladoga; and for the sake of the Crown
forests it would be desirable to improve the floating
on Uuksunjoki still farther east. On the lakes, the
floating takes place in large loose masses confined in a
framework of logs bound together, which are moved by
windlasses. On the larger lakes, where great masses are
collected, they are towed down by steam-tugs or by
pontoons with steam-windlasses. The transport across the
lakes costs little, and the floating of loose logs in the
river is not expensive; but the rafts, which it is
necessary to use in the outlets of the rivers, cost more. The
floating business clashes here with fishery rights, which
are now, however, of very little value compared with
the transport of lumber, even where, as in the rivers
Torneå and Kemi, they yield 40,000 and 100,000
marks a year. The restriction of floating to a short
time during the year on account of the fisheries is a
great loss of money, because the logs for this reason
have to be two or three years under way. As soon as
it is known that the floating will take more than
a year, the bark is taken off the firs, as it is always
taken off the pines. Considerable loss is caused by
the sinking of the logs.

Farther down the country the floating is now as a
rule well arranged, although here, too, much remains
to be done. A large part of the work undertaken
by the government has been for the purpose of
hindering the floods, as for instance those on the
Kumo and the rivers in Southern Ostrobothnia. In
the north the government has a large direct interest in
floating, because of its enormous forest property. It would
now pay to carry out some large works even on the
great rivers running out into the Polar Sea, the 
Tenojoki and Paatsjoki, on which a large mass of the
lumber which will soon be cut down in the Enare
Lapmark may be floated, as well as on several
watercourses on the eastern frontier, which are affluents of
other rivers running out partly into the Polar Sea and
partly into the White Sea. Also as regards the Torneå
and its affluents, complaints are made of the expense,
often more than 1 mark per log, which might be
reduced by more than a third, notably by arranging
the floating of loose logs. On its affluent, the Tenkeliö,
over 5 marks each has been paid for thousands of
trunks, or more than they cost in the forest. On the
Torneå, half a million logs per year are now floated,
and in the Kemi and its affluent, the Ounasjoki, more
than a million. From the upper parts of these rivers,
as well as of the Ijo, Uleå, and other northern rivers,
hundreds of thousands of logs are floated at one mark
and two marks each, or even more. On the Uleå, the
Uleåborg Saw-Mill Company has acquired an actual
monopoly, and it is not the only instance where single
companies or associations have been able to obtain
such a privilege, to the loss of other people and of the
government itself as proprietor of the forests. The
government ought to undertake a series of works on
these northern rivers, as has been recommended by
the committee of the government forests.

Finland has 3700 kilometres of coast. It is
therefore only natural that the country should expend a
considerable amount on lighthouses, buoys, and beacons,
as well as on pilots. In all more than a million marks
per annum is spent, besides extraordinary expenses.
About 1100 men are employed as pilots. It is of
great importance to maintain the navigation during
the winter from Åbo and Hangö to Sweden, as well as
to other countries, and a good case for subventions is
thought to exist, not only for the sake of the mails,
but also for the export, especially of butter, to England.
By means of two powerful ice-breakers, bought for
700,000 and 1¼ million marks, it is now possible to
keep Hangö open the whole winter, while another
icebreaker accomplishes the same work at Åbo.

The old Swedish provincial laws made it the duty
of the landholders of the villages to build bridges or
to keep ferries, as well as to open up roads which were
of importance to the whole country or to the härad,
the parishes, the mills, or finally to their own cattle.
They had to contribute according to the value of their
land. In a country so thinly populated and of such
large extent as Finland the only roads were, however,
for a long time the waterways during the summer and
the snow during the winter. Parliaments and all
other public assemblies were always held near the
sea. Even in the south public messages were sent
during the winter by runners on Scandinavian
snowshoes or “ski.” Later on, high roads were made
which, like the railways in modern times, followed
the long terminal moraines which, on account of their
regular character and stony ground, were easily
transformed into roads. In the middle of the sixteenth
century about 2000 kilometres of roads were perhaps
in existence, but owing to the subsequent wars it was
a long time before others were constructed. Even in
the beginning of the nineteenth century the country
only had about 10,000 kilometres of roads. Distant
districts had often nothing but horse paths as a means
of communication with the outer world, and on the
lakes and rivers communication by boat is still often
used instead of by road. The people moved, and
move sometimes still in the far interior, in the same
manner as the Indians in Western America, where
they carry their goods by means of two connected
poles drawn along the ground by a horse.

In recent times the construction of roads has been
carried on in the same manner as other public work
in Finland, at once with great energy and careful
financing. There are now about 44,000 kilometres
of roads, 25,000 kilometres of highroads, and 19,000
of by-ways. This is an average of about 17 kilometres
per 1000 inhabitants. The State has maintained the
old obligation of the landholders to construct roads,
but has assisted them where it was necessary to
undertake larger works in the public interest, especially in
bad years when the people had need of work. The
State has itself made roads in the Lapmark, where the
sparse population could not do it, and where also the
Crown owns the largest part of the country. It has
been possible to make good roads with the gravel and
brash which are so common in the country and which
equal the macadamised pavements of other countries.
The work of the men and horses evidently does not
cost much, since the expense of the highroads is
reckoned at 6000 marks and of the by-ways at 3000
marks per kilometre, and the whole initial cost is
about 220 million marks with a yearly cost of
between 3½ million and 4 million marks.

Railways were only first decided upon after the
Crimean War in 1856, when Alexander II. had become
Emperor and visited Finland. Colonel Alfred Stjernvall 
had earlier proposed a horse tramway to connect
Helsingfors with the lakes in Tavastland. Herr J. V.
Snellman, the great patriot and popular leader, adopted
the idea, and the plan of a railway between Helsingfors
and Tavastehus was thereupon drawn up by Colonel
Knut Stjernvall, who later entered the service of
Russia and became Inspector-General of the Russian
Railways. This railway was constructed in 1857-62,
its length being 110 kilometres with the Russian
gauge of 1.524 metre; but instead of the calculated
cost of 88,000 marks per kilometre the cost was 14½
millions, or 131,000 marks per kilometre. No one
yet understood how to construct a railway cheaply,
and instead of obtaining a net revenue of 6 per cent.
it did not even pay its working expenses. The period
of liberalism had come, however, and the political
leaders of the country were not afraid to go on. In
1867 the Diet voted a loan of 18 million marks for
a line connecting this railway with St. Petersburg.
Part of the railroad would pass Russian ground, and
the whole was of considerable interest to St.
Petersburg. The Emperor Alexander wanted to maintain
the Russian gauge in opposition to the Finlander
engineers, and in order to facilitate the work he
granted a Russian State-loan of 10 million marks
against one-third of the net revenue. This sum has
lately been refunded to Russia. The line from
Riihimäki to St. Petersburg was constructed very cheaply;
it followed the moraine of Salpausselkä, by which much
work was saved. The line ran near the lake of
Päijänne and by a short connection to Saima. Its length
was 382 kilometres, and its cost only 74,000 marks
per kilometre; less than the estimated price. It was
finished in 1870; but had to be reconstructed and
extended in certain parts; so that the whole line
between Helsingfors, Tavastehus, and St. Petersburg,
with branches to the two other lake-systems, which
had originally cost 42 million marks, now reached a
total length of 519 kilometres and a total cost of 67
million marks, or 129,000 marks per kilometre. It
began by paying from 3 to 4 per cent., and now pays
6½ per cent.

In the speculative period after the Franco-German
war the possibility was discussed in Finland of
constructing railways as private enterprises. The
government proposed to the Diet to sell their railways to a
private company. The proposition was not accepted,
but private concessions were granted for railways to
Hangö, Borgå, and Åbo. The last was not constructed,
but the holders of the concessions for the lines
Hyvinge-Hangö and Borgå-Kervo built railways and
failed. The railroad to Hangö was then sold to the
government for about 10½ million marks, or 70,000
marks per kilometre through a length of 150
kilometres. The Borgå railway was transferred to a new
company. In 1874—76 the government itself built
the Åbo-Tavastehus-Tammerfors line, 211 kilometres,
for 19½ million marks, or 92,000 marks per kilometre.
It is only in recent times that some small private lines
have once more been built.

As in other countries, public opinion was divided
on the question whether the railways ought to be
built first in those parts of the country which most
need developing; or, on the contrary, in those which
are the richest and best populated. The intermediate
course was chosen: to begin in Southern Finland, but
to let the first lines pass the interior of the south,
where it would cost less to build and whence connections
could later be made with the ports. It would certainly
have been more advantageous to begin connecting the
towns on the coast, notwithstanding the larger expenses
here where the lines could not follow the ridges of
gravel and brash — the terminal moraines already
mentioned. Such lines would have been more used
and, in consequence, would have paid better. This
last view was strongly advocated by Herr Theodore
Tallqvist in Finland, and although his ideas have not
been entirely victorious, they undoubtedly had a
favourable influence on the later plans for constructing
railways. Probably it would still pay for the Finnish
government itself to build a line along the whole
coast.

In 1877 it was decided both to continue the
railway-making and to construct the lines very cheaply.
For this reason a speed of 25 kilometres an hour and
rails weighing only 22.3 kilograms per metre were
considered sufficient. This price is not much more
than the cheap roads on the American prairies —
$15,000 per English mile, or 1<sup>2</sup>/<sub>5</sub> kilometres. It was,
however, soon found necessary to employ heavier
locomotives, and heavier rails weighing 25 to 30
kilograms per metre, as well as to run trains at 30
kilometres an hour.

Later, a series of lines was constructed in
Ostrobothnia (the present provinces of Vasa and Uleåborg)
and in Savolaks, these lines costing from 50,000 to
60,000 marks per kilometre, or as much as 70,000
marks in Carelia and 83,000 on to Björneborg. There
was a cheaper line in the interior from Jyväskylä to
Suolahti costing 68,000 marks, and finally a more
expensive more direct line to Åbo, while at the same
time a line was constructed in the interior from Kuopio
to Iisalmi, and another in the north from Uleåborg to
Torneå is under construction. During the last decade
5 to 7 million marks per annum have been spent on
railways. In the present interval between two Diets
(four years) the Estates wanted to use a much larger
amount, and voted for this purpose a loan of 35 million
marks, but the government has decreased the sum to
25 millions.

At the end of 1899 the government railways had
a total length of 2651 kilometres built for a total cost
of 250,780,000 marks, or about 94,000 marks per
kilometre. Half of this amount was procured by loans,
half paid out of the current revenue. This is an
average of 0.7 kilometre per 100 square kilometres,
that is to say, about the same proportion as in Russia;
where, however, the largest portion of the railways is
located much farther south. It is more than in Norway,
but only one-third of the proportionate railway mileage
in Sweden, and of course much less than in the other
more advanced and better populated countries, among
which Belgium, for example, has as much as one
kilometre of railway lines in less than 6 square kilometres.
In proportion to the number of inhabitants, there are
in Finland 10.4 kilometres per thousand inhabitants.
This is about equal to Denmark, France, and Germany.
Only Sweden has much more — about double the
proportionate railway mileage of Finland. The proportion
is inferior in Norway, as well as in countries such as
Great Britain and Belgium. The proportion is much
less in Russia, although here, too, the population is
rather scanty in the greater part of the country.

Of private railroads there are now about 200
kilometres, the most important being branch lines from
some of the lesser towns on the coast to the
government lines, with the same gauge as these. There are
also one or two short, less expensive, narrow-gauge
lines to some of the large works and factories. Such
roads will probably continue to be constructed as private
enterprises, but the government ought to build more
along the coast in the populous part of the country.

The passenger and goods traffic varies in volume.
While the northern part of the Carelian line has only
14,000 kilometres of journeys per annum, the line from
St. Petersburg to the summer resorts has 1½ million.
Among the more important lines the proportion varies
from 23,000 on the Uleåborg line, and 25,000 on the
Hangö line, to 66,000 on the Åbo line, and 173,000
on the Helsingfors-Tavastehus line. As always, the
larger volume of traffic is nearest the towns.

The goods traffic varies in the same manner, being
as much as 313,000 kilometre-tons near St. Petersburg, 
307,000 near Helsingfors, and only 10,000 to
14,000 on the lines Björneborg and Uleåborg, 31,000
in Savolaks, 32,000 in Carelia. 35,000 in Vasa, 57,000
on the Hangö line, and, finally, 103,000 on the Åbo
line, and 170,000 on the whole Helsingfors-Tavastehus-St. Petersburg 
line. Most of the goods traffic goes to
the ports, since Finland, as we have said, is exporting
much heavier goods than it imports. On the Hangö
line butter forms about half of the whole of the goods
traffic; and throughout the whole country lumber
represents half of the total.

Interesting experiences have followed decreases in
the fares. A lowering of the tariff of 1886 at once
produced a good result, and it was therefore continued.
The third-class passenger fares have been decreased by
20 per cent., the second-class by 17, the first by 10
per cent. At the same time a rebate of 5 per cent,
per 100 kilometres is given for longer journeys, and
circular and return tickets have been introduced, with
the result that a third-class return ticket for 1000
kilometres, for instance, is reduced by 46 per cent.
Also the goods tariff has been decreased. The result
has been, as in Hungary when the zone tariff was
introduced, a considerable increase in the use of the
railroads, and also a largely increased gross revenue.
The passenger traffic increased during the period
1896-8 from 7,194,000 marks to 8,977,000; the goods
traffic from 10,483,000 to 12,776,000 marks. The
increase was so considerable that there was not sufficient
rolling-stock to carry it. Expenses increased in the
period 1895-8 from 10,120,000 marks to 14,386,000
marks; the gross revenue from 15,456,000 to
22,004,000 marks; or 42 per cent. in both cases.
If, however, we compare 1896 and 1898, the revenue
increased only 23 per cent. against 34 per cent.
increase in the expenses. For 1899 we have, however,
again 25 million gross revenue and 17½ million
expenses. It is, of course, in the public interest that
communication should be facilitated even if the
government does not gain by it, so long as it does not actually
lose money. The railways are of especially great
importance for national industry, because the goods traffic
in Finland, as in the United States, holds a much more
important place compared to the passenger traffic than
is the case in manufacturing countries, where there is
not so great a mass of raw products to transport to
the ports.

The net revenue of the lines varies. It was said
that it decreased during certain periods in consequence
of the extension; but it would be more correct to say
that this was a result of construction in more distant
parts of the country. Another influence is, however,
exercised by the above-mentioned periodical
fluctuations in all kinds of business. In 1870 the net
revenue per kilometre was 1700 marks; in 1880 it
was 3101 marks; in 1895 it was only 2300 marks:
and in 1897, when the cheaper tariff was introduced
after May 1, it was 3000 marks. One year after the
construction of the line to St. Petersburg hardly 2 per
cent. was paid on the expended capital; in 1874, a
good year, it was over 4; but in 1878 it was only 1.7.
Again in 1882 it was nearly 4, but after the
construction of the Vasa line, it was less than 3; in 1883
3.6; after the addition of the Uleåborg line in 1886-7
only 2½; again 3.3; in 1892, after a bad harvest, it
was down to 2½; in 1896-7 again 3.6. Thereafter
there was great progress, but at the end of 1900 the
progress ceased.

It is an important argument for the construction
and working of railways by the government that the
same net income can be produced in different ways.
A greater traffic with larger expenses is evidently
advantageous to the people if only the net income
does not decrease. In enterprises such as railways
there is always a large amount of public profit which
does not appear in the interest on the capital or as
individual profit. It is impossible to arrange a tariff
to pay for all the advantages obtained; in the case of
some persons the advantage does not much exceed
what they pay, while it becomes much more considerable 
in other cases. This is not peculiar to railways;
it is more or less the case in all economical enterprises.
The existence of much good service which is not paid
for is, however, more prominent in an enterprise such
as a railway, where as a rule there is no great equalising
of prices brought about by a number of competitors.
The railway has always more or less a monopoly,
because a considerable profit is necessary before it
becomes practicable, even where there is no hindrance
through legislation, to construct a competing line
alongside the one first constructed. In its character
of a monopoly the railway is always to some extent
arbitrary, the working and the tariff being arranged
for the sake of private profit, whether the net profit is
obtained by more or less gross profit. This character
of a natural monopoly renders it very necessary that
some public authority should have control over the
railway, and that it should at least settle the tariff
even if it does not itself construct and work the line.

The question whether, in a country like Finland,
the government ought to build the larger lines or not,
was decided by the simple fact that the capital could
not possibly be obtained in any other manner, or at
least not so cheaply as by the credit of the State.
And Finland had a class of officials capable and honest
enough to carry through such an enterprise. Common 
sense, therefore, determined the action of the
government in this case.

To turn now to the postal system. Its earliest
beginning may be said to have been the “budkafle”
(“budstikke” in Danish-Norwegian), a stick with
signs on it by which the words of the king, as well as
messages about acts of violence, were sent round to
the villages and towns. If the stick was burned at
one end and tied with a string at the other it told of
an attack by the enemy. The police ordinance for
the villages as late as 1742 contained detailed rules
for the despatch of this post, and it may still be used
in the case of a great forest fire. The first real post
was organised by the Swedes, who in the Thirty Years’
War had seen a post organised in Germany by the
family of Taxis. This family, as will be remembered,
was at the head of the German post until quite
recent times, when it was seen that United Germany
was able to take better care of its post than a great
number of independent princes could do. German
experience suggested the organisation carried out in
Sweden in 1636, which was at first connected with
the publication of an official journal, <i>Tidningar och
Avisor</i>, this journal being still continued under the
name of <i>Post - och Inrikestidningar</i>. The peasant
farmers who were obliged to carry the post got a
reduction in their taxes. During the winter the post
was regularly carried round the Gulf of Bothnia.

Modern postal reform — that is, a uniform tariff
according to the system of Rowland Hill — was tried for
three years, beginning in 1844 as an experiment with
letters in Finland and to St. Petersburg, the charge
being 10 kopeks per Russian ounce for small letters
and 20 for larger sizes. From 1850 the tariff in
Finland was 5 kopeks for 125 versts (144 kilometres) and
10 kopeks for longer distances. Stamps were only
introduced in 1856 as an experiment for two years,
and were finally adopted in 1857, at the same time
that they were introduced into Russia. Letter-boxes
were also introduced then. In the sixties the whole
modern postal system was in force.

The increase of postal matter has been considerable, 
as in most other countries, growing from 8½
millions in 1881 to 31 millions in 1897. In ten
years, 1891-1900, the increase was 125 per cent.,
the largest increase being in wrappers, parcels, and
postal cards. There was also a considerable
increase in letters and newspapers, the smallest
increase being in free official communications. Letters
and postal cards increased in the period 1888-97
from 2.4 to 5.2 per head, and all postal matter from
6.3 to 12.3 per head. The net profit made by the
government, besides free official communication, was
in 1897 one-third, in 1898 half a million marks.

In 1890 the transfer of the post to the Russian
Minister of the Interior and the Russian Direction of
Posts and Telegraphs was decreed, notwithstanding the
fact that this was contrary to the constitution of
Finland. Finland has still really its own post, but modern
reforms have been stopped. Especially an excessive
tariff of 20 and 50 penni is maintained for letters
and postal orders, and when the Diet asked for a
decrease the Emperor answered, according to the
recommendation of the Governor-General, that he
would not allow Finland to decrease its tariff as
long as Russia could not decrease her tariff! The
wizening hand is laid on this department of the
administration. Recently the introduction of Russian
stamps was the occasion of a considerable commotion 
in Finland, although it was so arranged that
Finland still keeps her own postal revenue. 

Just as the peasants were obliged to carry messages
and, later, the post, so they had also to furnish
horses to travellers. Peasants who were under this
obligation, and also kept inns for the travellers, had
their taxes reduced. For a long time the pay was
very low, and the obligation was regarded as a heavy
burden, which was transferred in regular order from
one farmer to another. Now the pay is somewhat
higher. After the construction of the railways the
postal roads were less used, and where there is much
traffic the horsing of travellers is most often
undertaken by private persons under an arrangement with
the government.

The old “optical” telegraph from Sweden to Finland
was established at the end of the eighteenth century
for military defence. It was re-established by the
Russian Government during the Crimean War; and
in 1854, when its defects became manifest, the
Emperor Nicholas ordered the Russian Minister of
Communications to arrange an electric telegraph between
St. Petersburg and Helsingfors. This was at once
taken in hand by the Berlin house of Siemens and
Halske. It was only after the war that the telegraph
was open to the public. In 1856 telegraphing to
other countries in German was permitted; and in
1858, after the cities of Helsingfors, Åbo, and Viborg
had declared their willingness to contribute, telegraphing
on the line St. Petersburg-Åbo-Helsingfors was
permitted in Swedish. As neither the Russian
Telegraph Direction nor the Finnish Senate would incur
new expenses, a private company proposed to take
over the telegraph, but as this proposition was not
approved, the Emperor Alexander finally allowed the
establishment of a line to Torneå on condition that the
towns contributed to the expense. The demand of the
Diet in 1863 for a public or private telegraph system
for Finland was rejected, but was the occasion of a
decrease in the tariff. Progress came later from
participation in the general European telegraph
conferences, and cables to Sweden have been laid by the
Great Northern Telegraph Company. In 1899 there
were 4900 kilometres of lines, and in 1898 about
2 million telegrams passed over them, of which,
however, less than 400,000 were inland messages, and less
than 200,000 came from other countries to Finland,
whilst about 1½ million passed the lines <i>en route</i> to
other countries. The telegraph tariff is in several
respects too high, and in the whole country there are
only sixty-six telegraph offices. Legally, the position of
the Russian telegraph in Finland is about the same as
that of a private company, just as the railway owned by
the Finnish Government on Russian soil has about
the same position in Russia as a Russian private
railway.

Finland has its own telegraph along the railways.
At the end of 1898 there were about 4400 kilometres
with 204 offices.

Possibly it is a consequence of the Russian telegraph 
restrictions, or more possibly an expression of
the vigour with which the Finlanders have recently
kept pace with modern progress, that the telephone
has come into use in the most extraordinary manner
in Finland, even more remarkably than in Sweden
and Norway. This has chiefly been possible because
no patents or monopolies have hindered its
development. The Senate gives concessions to companies as
well as to private persons. A Swedish company
decided in 1880 to introduce a telephone with American
instruments into Helsingfors, but it was only in the
summer of 1882 that the necessary hundred subscribers
joined, and a beginning could really take place. A
telephone was already installed in Åbo with Swedish
Ericsson instruments, and only thirty subscribers. The
telephone is now found everywhere, even in the
country; in 1898 there were 300 centrals. A
company for connecting the towns in southern Finland
was established in 1894, and introduced everywhere
double wires between the towns, on lines which, at the
end of 1898, extended over 4700 kilometres. Other
companies have been formed for connecting the towns
in other parts of the country. The telephone is very
cheap; it costs ten marks per annum in Mariehamn
on Åland, where there is a telephone for every nine
persons, and 20 marks in Nykarleby; elsewhere it
varies from 30 to 75 marks, though in Helsingfors
it costs 60 and 102 marks, and in Viborg 85 and
100 marks. The use of the telephone has entered
thoroughly into the daily life of the people, and it now
holds an important place in the economic as well as in
the social and intellectual existence of the nation.

<h2><small>CHAPTER X</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>THE EXCHEQUER AND CIVIC DUTIES</small></small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> no country in Europe is the financial situation
better than in Finland. The country is not burdened
by very heavy taxes, all public departments are well
taken care of, and there is a good balance on the
budget. There are also large reserve funds of different
kinds, and the Finnish State owns a considerable
extent of productive properties worth several times
more than the inconsiderable public debt, a debt which
has been entirely incurred for productive purposes.
Apart from external disturbances, the future of the
country is assured. The State economy has been still
better than the private; the present situation is good,
and the condition of the finances permits all desirable
reforms.

Constitutional reasons account for the peculiarly
complicated form of Finland’s budget. The Sovereign,
without the co-operation of the Diet, applies all
permanent public revenue to the normal necessities of the
State, while the Diet votes other public expenses, for
which taxes imposed for a limited period or public
loans are necessary. The budget voted by the Estates
embraces a period of three, four, or, at the utmost, five
years, <i>i.e.</i> the interval between the sessions of the Diet,
including the first year after a session as well as the
year of the next session. Notwithstanding the budget
arrangement of separate funds and departments, the
estimates made by the Division of Finance of the
Senate and the Committee of Finance (<i>i.e.</i> of Ways
and Means, Supply and Appropriation), embrace the
total revenue and expenses of the State. The decision
of the Estates as to the grants which they shall vote
is based on the estimate made by this committee of
the ordinary revenue and its sufficiency to meet the
expenses, while the statement presented by the
committee at the end of each Diet contains also a budget
for the whole period, giving a perfect insight into the
entire financial situation.

Of the budget for the period 1901-4 we give the
following averages for each of these years:—

<table><td><td c><sc>Marks.</sc>
<td>Total of the ordinary average yearly revenue,
therein being comprised the voted taxes,
is estimated at 	<td r>70,273,000

construction, total 35 million, or per
annum  <td r>8,750,000
<td>Surplus from the preceding financial period, to
be used yearly  <td r>4,634,000

for construction of railroads of 22¼ million
marks, estimated at <td r>25,325,000
<td><td r>_________
<td r>Grand total <tab><tab><tab><td r>83,284,000
</table>

In this budget the government has made one
alteration, that the expenditure on railways should be
decreased, and the loan made for this purpose be
decreased by 10 million marks. Some minor lines
and subventions to other minor lines were not
approved of.

Of the ordinary revenue the taxes yield 48½ millions,
or 69 per cent.; income of capital and other property,
railways, canals, and public enterprises, 2⅔ millions,
or 29.5 per cent.; divers revenue, 1.5 per cent. The
most important taxes are the custom duties, estimated
at 32 millions, which is a low estimate; thereafter the
excise on alcohol, 6¾ millions; taxes on land, 3¼;
personal taxes, 2,100,000; stamp taxes, 1,700,000;
malt tax under one million (a rather low estimate);
duties on the sawmills, or rather on exported lumber,
under half a million; finally, some less considerable
taxes, payment for passports, and other minor fees.

Among the revenue derived from Government
property and enterprises the surplus of the railroads
is the most important, averaging 9,300,000 marks;
the gross revenue of the large government forests is
estimated very low, at 2⅔ millions; gross profit on the
post, 3,800,000; gross profit on the canals, 525,000;
interest-bearing funds, 1,300,000. Of the Bank of
Finland’s surplus the Diet appropriates 900,000
marks per annum. The gross profit system is correct
as concerns the statement of all real public expenses,
but it is hardly correct not to deduct the expenses of
enterprises in which the government is acting rather
as a private trader.

A good impression is created by a study of the
public expenses, especially of the large amount applied
to further general intellectual and material
development. More than one million is put down as
reimbursement of public duties, from the custom-house,
&c. The superior administration costs about 2 millions,
among which may be noted some hundreds of thousands
disposed of by the Emperor personally. Hardly 3½
millions are expended by the Department of Justice,
including 1½ million for the prisons. Some of the
expenses for the courts, however, pass through the
Communes, and not through the State treasury. The
financial administration, especially the expenses of the
custom-house, demands 2¼ millions; the custom-house 
rather less than in most other countries. The
civil administration requires 6½ millions, including over
2 millions for sanitary purposes. Among other special
expenses may be noted the large amounts already
mentioned as paid for the post and the administration
of the forests; to which, as we have suggested, an
even larger amount might be applied profitably. Of
great interest are the considerable sums paid to the
public schools, which together with grants to the
Church amount to over 10 millions. Only half a
million of this is paid to the Lutheran State Church,
which obtains most of its resources from the
congregations; and about one million is granted to the University.
The balance of the budget for the general Department
of Instruction is now about 8 millions, of which 4
millions yearly go to the elementary schools.
Manufactures and commerce get over 2¾ millions, including
half a million for technical schools, of whose expenses
the Communes pay the larger part. Agriculture and
matters connected with it obtain 3 millions, in which
are included grants to agricultural schools, measures
in the interest of creameries and dairies, contributions
to the economic societies, &c. Relatively moderate
sums are applied to military defence and the payment
of interest on debt. In most other countries, where
the debt is generally the result of old wars, these
two items absorb two-thirds of the total State
expenses. In Finland the ordinary amount voted for
military defence is only 6½ millions; for the debt,
including some amortisation, a little more than 6
millions. We may further mention that the State of
Finland is comparatively liberal in pensions to its
officials, the sum for which, together with amounts
paid in cases of death to widows and children as well
as contributions to a fund for these latter, is about 2
millions. Certain of the expenses might be criticised,
none more severely than the 100,000 marks expended
on the censorship of publications, especially the press.
But, on the whole, this budget will bear comparison
with those of other countries, both by its good economy
and its intelligent liberality.

The total debt of Finland in 1899 was only 115
millions, or about half of what the railways have cost
and are worth according to their revenue. Of this
1½ million is the balance of the first loan from Russia
in 1859; 2½ millions the balance of the railway loan
of 1868 arranged with Erlanger & Sons as premium
loan; 38⅓ millions the balance of a loan of 1889 from
Bleichroder and others at 3½ per cent. The debt also
includes about 17½ millions at 3½ per cent. borrowed
in 1895, and about 55 millions at 3 per cent. (closed
in 1898), both borrowed through the Bank of Finland
from the Crédit Lyonnais, the Banque de Paris et des
Pays-Bas, the Union Bank and the Northern Joint-Stock 
Bank in Finland, the Stockholms Enskilda
Bank, the Danish Landmandsbank, Behrens & Söhne
in Hamburg, and the Deutsche Bank and the
Dresdner Bank in Berlin. Finally, there is a loan of 25
millions arranged in 1901 at 3½ per cent, with the
same banks.

The method of voting supply must be mentioned in
order to understand the budget and the accounts. In
itself there is not much to say against the exemption
of regular revenue from the votes of the Estates. They
have influence enough in so far as their consent is
required for new demands, this being always necessary.
But, as we have said, there was this weak point in the
old Swedish constitution at the end of the eighteenth
century, that the government could increase the
customs tariff without asking the Estates, so that the
whole of this important department was outside their
influence. This restriction has been severely felt in
modern Finland, and might impair the efficient
co-operation of the estates with the government in public
affairs. It is chiefly in consequence of historical
conditions that the budget is divided into separate
funds. The large portion controlled by the Crown
only is called the General State Fund. The other
portion, which is decided by the co-operation of the
Diet, is again divided into three parts — (1) the
so-called Voted Fund, consisting of the taxes voted only
provisionally, the appropriated part of the profit of the
Bank of Finland, and sometimes a contribution from
the General State Fund, from which the expenses of
the elementary schools and a contribution to
military defence are paid; (2) the Military Fund, consisting
of the land taxes and rent of land which was used for
the old army under the military tenure system, and of
sums voted specially by the Diet; (3) the Fund
for the Means of Communication; this is not what
is called a capitalised fund, or a fund which has
its own capital; it is only for the purpose of giving to
the railroad construction a financial basis independent
of the other parts of the budget or of the economy of
the State. Under this fund is included as expenditure
the interest and amortisation of the railway loans, and
the estimated expenses of construction; and as revenue
the net income of the railways, the larger part of the
tax on alcohol, and the new loans for railway
construction.

The estimate of the ordinary revenues belonging to
the General State Fund, of which the government
alone disposes, has always been made with such great
caution that during the last few decades the actual
revenues have regularly and considerably exceeded the
budget estimate. According to a regular practice, the
government, as it begins to foresee the real surplus of
the year, decides the extraordinary expenses which are
needed, as, for instance, public buildings, work on the
canals, &c., but considerable sums have also been put
aside as separate funds for different purposes. The
most important is the General State Reserve, which in
1898 amounted to 7¼ million marks, placed in easily
saleable foreign bonds. It is destined, in case of war
or other misfortunes, to make up possible deficiencies
in the revenue. The largest fund, however, is the
Loan Fund, amounting to over 16½ millions; it grants
loans to be repaid in rates to the Communes, also to
shipowners and manufacturers. Among the larger
funds are also the “Assistance Fund“ of 3½ millions, a
special reserve fund to help poor Communes in years
of famine. The oldest is the Military Fund of about
10 millions, the interest of which is used for
military pensions. Besides these, there are a number of
minor funds, such as the Fund for Loans to Dairies,
a fund for taking care of orphans and waifs,
another to pension teachers in elementary schools,
&c. The total amount of these “capitalised funds”
was in 1898 about 45 million marks. They are
managed by the Treasury Office, which, under the
control of the Finance Division of the Senate, places
the funds in government bonds, Finnish or foreign,
or deposits them in the banks, where, according to
the rules for such special funds, the capital may
be lent out. When the question arose of retaining
these funds, the elder Rothschild was quoted as saying
that “a number of separate funds did not exactly
make any man poor.” Formerly very large amounts
appear to have been standing in very accessible form,
especially as deposits in the banks.

Partly by ordinance of 1899, which came into
force at the beginning of 1901, and partly at an
earlier period, the public finances have been
completely centralised. They are separated in the books
and not in the Treasury, which contains now the
proceeds of the different funds, of which a common
cash account is kept. The University has its own
cashier, but for the ordinary departments everything
not needed for current expenses is paid into the
common current account of the general Treasury,
and no separate office may from day to day keep
more than 50,000 marks. On this common account
payment-orders are made by the general Treasury
as well as by the provincial governors’ offices, these
later on sending into the general Treasury specified
statements of what they have paid in and taken
out. This rule is followed everywhere where a separate
account is kept, and if the Bank of Finland has no
branch office at a place, the money is paid into a
private bank. At all offices, as, for instance, those
of the railways, of the post, the University, and the
Finnish passport office in St. Petersburg, the cash
account is audited at least once a month. By means
of this new order, which was in preparation for more
than ten years, since 1888, and which is now finally
in force, it is believed that a financial organisation
has been obtained as good as that of modern
constitutional States with their budget and accounts.
Statements have to be handed in early enough to
be prepared and included in the budget. The budget
may not be exceeded without special permission from
the government, that is from the Economic
Department of the Senate. The calendar year is reckoned
as the financial year, and at the end of the year
all accounts of cash and materials are closed. What
has not been used in the course of the year cannot
be used later, or for other purposes, except where
the amount has not been given for certain definite
uses, or is expressly reserved for an object not
confined to the year; and even in this case it is not
allowable to use more than half of what was given
for the preceding year. The books must be closed
before the following March, and sent in before May
for audit. In closing them the budget estimate is
strictly followed.

Besides the government funds we may mention
a group of local funds established for public use.
The total of these at the end of 1898 was not less
than 40½ million marks, of which over 24½ millions
were in the towns, and less than 16 millions in the
country. Funds amounting altogether to 22 millions
exist to give assistance of different kinds: 8 millions
as a fund for pensions; 7½ for the poor; 2⅓ for help
of a general character; 3 for hospitals and nursing,
1¼ for sailors; also funds of more than 2¾ millions for
Church purposes; a fund of 4¾ millions for schools
and libraries ; 1⅓ million for scholarships ; 3 millions
for agriculture; 3⅓ millions for forestry; and about
1½ million for constructing roads and bridges,
establishing gardens, plantations, &c. Besides these funds,
there are pension funds amounting to 31¼ millions
for widows and orphans and for different classes of
officials.

It is of interest to record what is known about
the assets of the State. Most of the funds we have
mentioned show the progress in civilisation of the
country, but have no bearing on the public finances.
Besides these funds we have, however, a kind of roll
of public properties, drawn up in 1891. It amounted
to a total of 207½ million marks, of which 106¼ 
millions were the value of the government forests.
According to the prices of the last few years their
value is certainly more than double this latter figure.
The canals were reckoned at 21 millions, but have
a value of at least 25 millions. The farms which
belonged to the old army under the military tenure
system were valued at 7½ millions; the State
property which was formerly a part of the Russian
donations at under half a million; agricultural schools more
than 1½ million; and the old Crown-lands, properties
belonging to the civil administration and fisheries,
over 3½ millions. This roll of public properties
embraces also public buildings of different kinds,
barracks, schoolhouses, hospitals, &c., properties,
however, which have hardly anything to do with the
public finances. The total assets of a real financial
character, domains, capital-funds, railways and canals,
can be valued at about 600 millions, against a total
debt of 140 millions, including the new loan of
1901 of 25 million marks.

While we admire the excellent economy of the
Finnish Government, its forethought, and the sound
character of its ordinary public economy as well as of
the proportion between debt and capital, we may ask
whether there is not some lack of security consequent
on the relations with Russia. We do not think that
there is the least reason for doubt here. Whatever
may be said against the Russian Government and its
administration, it must be recognised that the Government 
in St. Petersburg acts always on the very strictest
principle in all questions of finance and credit.

Whether or not this is due to a perception of
self-interest, or is a consequence of the great difference in
principle which is found in the different parts of the
Russian Government, it is a fact which cannot be
denied. We are fully convinced that in these matters
there will never be the least question of any
transgression whatever in relation to Finland. It would be
against the whole tradition which the rulers in St.
Petersburg have always followed, and which with them
has been a point of honour. It would be against all
the interests of Russia. In short, it is an entire
impossibility. But here, as elsewhere, the authorities in
St. Petersburg would give the best guarantee of their
<i>bona fides</i> if they would more strictly follow the
demands of the constitution and the rights of Finland.

For the purpose of obtaining a complete idea of the
public burdens and the public resources, it will be
necessary to examine the finances of the Communes, in
addition to those of the government. The Church in
Finland is a separate institution. We have already
referred to the considerable extent and not inconsiderable 
value of the 700 rectories and vicarages of the
country. There is not any complete statement of the
property and income of the Church in existence. The
statistical account of Herr Järvinen, recently published,
states only that in 1891 there was paid to the Church
in the country 3½ million marks, of which half came
from the land, according to the so-called “mantal”;
one quarter was from a personal tax under the same
conditions as those of the general personal tax to which
we shall again refer; and one quarter from a tax on
cattle, which are supposed to represent an important
part of the resources of country people who do not
own land.

Although Communal laws are of recent date,
Communal life is comparatively well-developed, more so
than might be supposed from the limited resources of
the Communes; a fact due to the old Swedish
self-government. The sums collected and expended are
the largest in the towns, although they embrace a very
small part of the population. They have the largest
budget and the largest amount of property and debt,
although here, too, it is only a question of relatively
small amounts. Their properties were valued at the
beginning of 1899 at a total of 59 millions, of which
about 27 millions are represented by houses and ground
in the towns themselves, 15½ millions by country land,
fishery rights, &c., millions by invested capital, and
10 millions by property of other kinds. In 1891 the
total amount was 25½ millions. The total debt at the
beginning of 1899 was stated to be 26 millions, against
13 in 1891; of this at the beginning of 1899 Helsingfors 
claimed about 10 millions, Åbo 3¾, Tammerfors
about 3, and Viborg 2 millions. The more prosperous
towns have the larger debt, in consequence of entering
on larger enterprises. The amounts have increased
rapidly in later years; Helsingfors, for instance, in 1900
had a debt of 12¾ millions, and in 1901 it was expected
to exceed 14 millions as a consequence of large public
works. The revenue and expenditure of all the towns
together in 1898 was reckoned at 15 millions on each
side, against 9 millions in 1890; of which former
amount 2 million marks of income came from land
and lake and river rights, 3 millions from taxes on
trade and industries, and another 3 millions as
income-tax. These amounts only increased respectively from
1⅓ million, 2 millions, and 2⅓ millions in 1890, but
are now increasing more rapidly in some of the towns.
The income-tax in Helsingfors, for instance, was
estimated for 1901 at 1¾ million, against 1¼ in 1898.

The most considerable expenses are those common to
most towns, being in 1898 about 2 millions for schools,
2 millions for police, other sums for sanitary objects,
and so forth.

The Communes in the country had in 1898 a
revenue not much exceeding 5½ millions, and expenses
not much over 5⅓ millions. This is, on each side, not
much more than two marks per head, much less than
in other countries. Contrary to the case of all other
countries, where the Communal expenses as a rule
have increased heavily of late, the increase of expenses
and taxes in the Finnish rural communes has hardly
followed the increase of population. We have no
statement of their property; but their total indebtedness
was a little over 4¾ millions. In some cases it is
doubtful what to assign to the State and what to the
Commune, as, for instance, where the State has imposed
payment in kind which does not appear in any account.
This is the case with the roads, for instance, where
three-quarters of a million, paid in cash for work done
by contractors, and paid through the Communes chiefly
by a tax on land, passed the Communes, treasuries and
accounts; but the greater part, according to earlier
figures as much as 3½ millions, is paid in labour by
the landowners. The schools required in 1898 1⅓
million, and the poor-law contribution in 1891 was
reckoned at 2 millions, and does not seem to have
increased notwithstanding the improvement in the
paupers’ condition. Half a million was expended in
1898 for sanitary purposes, against one-third of a
million in 1891, and for other purposes a less amount.
Of the total revenue of 5½ millions, 4½ millions were
obtained by taxes in 1898, against 3½ in 1891. In
addition 1½ million was raised in 1891 by a kind of
income-tax, to which we shall refer later; one million
as land tax; half a million as a poll-tax on grown-up
persons; a quarter of a million as another personal tax;
45,000 as a tax on what was known as “rök” (“smoke
from the hearth”), on which also some 100,000 marks
is paid to the State as a tax on families or on
habitations; a small tax yielding 88,000 marks on
manufacturing establishments, which goes chiefly to maintain
the roads; a small amount as inheritance tax (raised
under an old ordinance of 1698, which permits a tax
of one-eighth per cent. on inheritances for the benefit
of the poor); and in exceptional cases some taxes on
cows or other cattle. We quote these details as
curious remnants of old taxation. The new law of
1898 extended the income-tax to all members of the
Communes as well as the landowners.

If we want to know the total amount and details of
the direct taxes, it will be necessary to add the taxes
paid to the Church and to the Commune. According 
to the calculation of Herr Järvinen, the total was
about 16 millions, of which 54 per cent. goes to the
State, the latter figure including 33 per cent. in direct
payment, and more than 20½ per cent. in work on the
roads. Of the balance more than 25½ per cent. goes
to the Church, of which 21 £ per cent, is paid to the
clergy and the beadles, and 4 per cent. to the congregations; 
finally, 21 per cent. goes to the treasuries of
the Communes. This is one-third to the government
direct, above one-fourth to the Church, above
one-fifth to the Communes, and the same to the roads.

As elsewhere, the oldest of the existing direct
taxes is the land tax, the unit being the “mantal.”
According to the signification of the word, the tax was
originally imposed as a personal tax on the owners of
the land. At present each of the 19,500 “mantal”
embraces an average of 5 to 6 farms, as we have
already mentioned. Part of what is paid by the land
(in money or work) for the construction of roads and
other matters is portioned out on the “mantal”; but
the old tax paid to the Crown, the so-called “ordinary
rent,” is a fixed amount, which the Swedish
fundamental laws have promised shall never be changed.
This “ordinary rent” is reckoned according to particular 
units, called rouble taxes. The number of these
units for each farm or “hemman” has a definite relation
to the “mantal,” but not the same in different parts of
the country; the survey and mapping-out of the land
according to the laws of enclosure has been done and
is still going on in different periods; and a valuation
of the land for taxation purposes has been made at
these intervals according to different methods in the
different provinces. A permanent land tax necessarily
influences the value of land, and becomes therefore, in
fact, a mortgage belonging to the government instead
of a real tax. The Finnish legislators seem to have
recognised this simple truth better than modern
legislators in several other countries. The permanent
land tax, the most important of the direct taxes
paid to the State, has therefore not been touched.
What the landowners pay besides this tax, such
as labour for the construction and maintenance of
roads, the carrying of the post, and other matters, is
estimated at a total value of about 4 million marks.
The so-called rents of the Crown, as well as the less
valuable Crown tithes (that is, the two-thirds of the
old tithes which at the Reformation were given
to the State), make, together with other small
payments, a total of about 3½ million marks. If we
add to this about 2 millions to the Church and one
million to the Communes, we have a total land tax of
more than 10 million marks, which is not, however, as
surmised by the statistician, Herr Järvinen, 10 per
cent. of the net profit of the land, but according to
other valuations nearer 5 per cent.

The land tax is still paid partly in kind, or according
to periodically estimated prices of grain. This form
of payment is antiquated now when everybody is able
to sell his products. There is no reason for
maintaining this method of payment, and it would be in
the interest of the government as well as the
taxpayer to fix a permanent money-value. The Diet
advocated this reform in 1882, but the Senate refused
to adopt it.

Another direct tax is the personal tax paid under
the law of 1865, the so-called “mantalspenningar.”
It yields 2 million marks, the tax being two marks from
each man and one from each woman between the ages
of 16 and 64 years. The law of 1865, promulgated
after the first session of the newly revived Diet of
1863-4, introduced a great improvement on the
former excessive and unequal tax. The same tax is
levied in the Communes, but begins at 15 years of age,
and men and women do not everywhere pay in the
same proportion as to the State. This tax has been
imposed for the benefit of the poor on all persons able
to work, who may presumably themselves some time
have need of this assistance. A small contribution
to the law courts in the country is a personal tax
on the different classes of landholders, with total
or partial exemption for poorer holders or tenants
who do not own land themselves.

The “centonal,” or one per cent. of the salaries
and pensions of functionaries, which goes to the
military fund, and amounts to 100,000 marks, can
hardly be said to be imposed according to any principle
of taxation.

A tax of 100 marks paid by traders in the country
is undoubtedly very reasonable. John Stuart Mill
is right when he says that it is neither in the interest
of the traders themselves nor in the public interest
that there should be too many places for retail trade.
A smaller number are equalty useful and expenses are
thereby saved. Including a small amount paid by
chemists, of whom a limited number only is allowed,
this tax brings in half a million a year.

Old duties on special industries, such as the iron-tithe
and the hammer-tax, have been abolished; but a tax
is still paid by the saw-mills as export duty on their
wares, and a similar duty is paid on other forms of
lumber. We have already referred to this tax when
speaking of the proposals to extend it. It ought to
be entirely abolished.

An income-tax to the State, voted by the Diet in
1863-4, and paid during the period 1865-85, is of
interest because there has been a proposal to
reintroduce the tax. In the beginning the first 500
marks of a man’s income was free, and, as the tax
was calculated per 100 marks, where the chargeable
income was above 500 marks, it was really the first 550
marks which was free. Later, this amount was only free
in incomes not exceeding 2500 marks; up to 5000
marks four-fifths per cent. was paid; up to 10,000
marks 1 per cent.; and for incomes exceeding 10,000
marks 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> per cent. The system was ingenious, but
the tax did not bring in nearly enough ; during several
years it only yielded half a million for the whole
country, and even later improvements did not
produce any good result. It was not difficult to find
out the salary of the officials and other permanent
incomes, but the great mass of small incomes were
not taxed at all. Experience proved here, as 
elsewhere, what has been recognised by the English law,
that it is next to impossible to impose the income-tax
on the great mass of the people. Notwithstanding
the law, a great number of the peasants were never
rated. Too many incomes remained unchanged from
one year to another. The taxation was on the whole
not strict enough, and not even the officials
representing the State fulfilled their duty. Finally, it was
changed to a temporary tax, and as it was not
necessary for the budget, it was not renewed in 1885.

In the towns, where the income-tax was introduced
by the laws of 1873 and 1883, it is more strictly
levied than was the tax paid to the State. It is
imposed on the sources of income, such as houses, lands,
manufactures, and salaries. A person is assessed at
so and so many tax-öre, the öre being the old
Scandinavian word for a certain coin, but these tax-units
differ in the different cities, the larger cities demanding
only one tax-öre for each 400 marks, while the lesser
towns come down to even 200 marks. Incomes below
2 tax-öre (or 400 to 800 marks) are free; incomes
of 3 tax-öre pay half; incomes of 4 tax-öre (<i>i.e.</i> 800
to 1600 marks) pay full tax. In most of the towns the
tax is 2 per cent. of the income, sometimes 3 per cent.;
in some towns, on the other hand, it is only one per
cent. It is not just that mortgages should be taxed
twice, as is the case, the owner of the property not
being allowed to deduct the interest, which is also
taxed in the hand of the receiver; nor is it right that
stock should pay this tax both in the hands of the
owner and of the company. Of 3¾ million marks, the
amount of the tax in all cities in 1898, Helsingfors
alone contributed 1¼ million, and in 1901, as we
have mentioned, even 1¾ million.

According to the law of 1865, the Rural Communes
could to a certain extent impose a similar tax. The
laws, however, were not very definite; and very
different bases were used: capital or income, the
social position of the tax-payer, or revenue from
capital or from income, were taken. A law of 1898
has now introduced the same tax as in the cities.

New proposals for the levying of income-tax, the
last made by the committee for the drafting of bills
in 1898, were founded too much on the Prussian
model. The Prussian tax is the result of peculiar
conditions, and, both in its origin and its later
development, is very faulty. The rulers were afraid,
when it was introduced, of a real income-tax; they
said so; they would only attempt approximate justice.
The later developments have largely been shaped by
particular class interests, not least those of the greater
rural landowners. In reality, the English practice of
looking to the sources of income is much preferable, 
and in principle a large difference ought to be
recognised between the income of capital and the
income of labour. If this principle were recognised,
and if a sufficient deduction were allowed for the
single man or family where the man’s income
depends on his own exertions, the always arbitrary
and objectionable progressive tax would be avoided.
In 1899 the Estates with good reason voted against
the proposition to introduce the tax; it was not
necessary. It would possibly be useful, even if it
is not necessary, for the sake of the Communal
taxation to have a similar tax on capital and
income, to be paid also to the State. It might
replace the present personal tax, the
“mantals-penningar.” If such a tax should be introduced it
might be specially applied to a thorough reform of
the custom duties, though here arises a difficulty
because the custom duties — the most important part
of the system of taxes — do not depend on the vote
of the Diet.

The stamp duties in the budget for 1901-4 are
calculated at 1¾ million marks per annum, and as
usual are partly a tax imposed occasionally on capital,
and partly fees. The stamp duties in Finland are
of a comparatively liberal character. Like those in
Sweden they do not seriously hinder legal transactions,
cheques, bills, or other obligations, which in many other
countries are hampered with fees or taxes, to the great
detriment of certain forms of credit and of many other
economic transactions. As in Sweden, stamp-duties
are only paid when people come into contact with
public authorities. Inheritance in Finland is only
taxed by a very moderate stamp duty.

We need not mention the insignificant duty on
playing-cards, and we have already referred, when
speaking of the manufacture of these articles, to the
important excise on brännvin and beer, this last in the
form of a tax on malt, as well as to the injustice and
economical error of imposing a higher excise on the
larger breweries. The excise duties on brännvin for
the budget 1901-4 are estimated at 6¾ million marks,
but will probably amount to more, and also the duty on
malt will be more than one million, though estimated
somewhat below this amount. None of these duties
are very hard. The forms of collecting, as, for instance,
in the case of the beer tax on malt, might be improved
upon. The reasons given for forbidding the import
of brännvin and other ordinary alcohol do not seem
convincing.

The customs duties have been an excellent source of
revenue, and have been increasing rapidly. In 1826—34
they only yielded 660,000 roubles; in 1847-8 only
900,000 roubles; in 1858, after some reform in
the previous year, but before the considerable reform
of 1859, 1,300,000 roubles; in 1863, 2 million roubles;
which amounts must be multiplied by at least four to be
converted into marks. The amount estimated in the
present budget of 32⅓ million marks is too low if we
may judge from the 35 and 36 millions of 1898 and
1899, and nearly 40 millions of 1900.

How far the financial situation allows of a complete
reform of the customs duties is seen as soon as we
examine the composition of the total. Notwithstanding
the decrease in the duty on sugar imported from
Russia, which causes a loss to Finnish finance of some
millions, sugar and preparations of sugar contributed in
1900 12 millions, or 28½, per cent. of the total; coffee
gives between 3⅓ and 3½ millions, or about 10 per cent.;
tobacco, 3 millions, or about 9 per cent.; wines and
spirits, notwithstanding the prohibition of the import of
brännvin, about 2½ million, or 7 per cent.; fruit, one-half
to three-fourths of a million, or 2 per cent.; tea, one-third
of a million, or 1 per cent. Together with the excise
duties on brännvin and malt, these duties, which are,
or at all events can be made, purely fiscal, produce about
three-quarters of the total. If we remember the good
result of the last budget, as well as the by no means
excessive duty now demanded on articles so well able
to pay duty as alcoholic liquors and tobacco, we find
that it would be quite possible to abolish entirely all
the other duties. In fact, they are all detrimental to
the economic life of the country, and they are causing
difficulties at the custom-house. Such a total reform
would be possible without increasing the duty on such
an article as sugar, which is a good financial resource,
but which for other reasons had better be free or
slightly taxed. There is nothing to hinder the 
abolition of duties which are a burden to industry, such as
the 4 millions, or 11 per cent., paid on metals, as well
as the 2½ millions, or 7 per cent., paid on machines
and implements. There is nothing to hinder the
abolition of the 1 per cent. brought in by a duty on
meat and pork, or the duty on textiles (yarns and
cloths amounting altogether to 5 millions, or 8 per
cent., made up of 6 per cent. on piece goods and 2
per cent. on thread and yarn). Part of these duties
help considerably to give the manufactures of the
country a wrong direction, though it is true that
duties on silk, velvet, and other high-priced textiles
which are not at present manufactured in the country,
as well as the duty on Paris articles, are not protective.
They, too, however, are the cause of difficulties, delay,
and cost in the custom-houses, and for purely practical
reasons they ought to be entirely abolished. It is
only by limiting the collection to a very few articles of
financial importance that it becomes possible to avoid
arbitrary treatment, and to simplify materially the
custom-house administration. We will not here refer
to such articles as meat and pork, fish and maize,
which certainly ought not, as at present, to be taxed
when imported from other countries than Russia. In
Finland there is no serious hindrance to the
introduction of an almost ideal system of taxation. By
only taxing a few articles of considerable financial
value, the foreign commerce, which is of such enormous
importance to this northern country with its one-sided
economic conditions, might be greatly developed.
There is no financial necessity whatever to misdirect
economic forces or to diminish the consumption of
useful articles. The tariff of Finland is many times
better, for instance, than that of Russia or even than
that of France, Germany, and Sweden, so far as it
does not tax necessaries of life, such as grain, flour, &c.,
and also exempts, or at least only imposes moderate
duties, on raw material and other things used by
manufacturing industries. But a fresh and considerable 
measure of reform is much needed, and ought to
be carried through, notwithstanding all the difficulties
created on the part of Russia. Low duties are often
more productive financially than high ones, as was
seen in 1893, when the tariff war was declared with
Germany from the month of August, and when trade
with Germany at once sank to a total of 43 millions
from 50 in the previous year, and increased to 58
millions in the following year, when the war was over.

It is not lack of economic knowledge or class egotism
on the part of the Estates which has hindered this
important reform, and has permitted this department of
finance to remain an antiquated part of public life,
while nearly all the other departments were reformed
in the enlightened liberal period. More than once
since the first session of the Diet in 1863-4 the
Estates have asked for decreased duties which would
allow more commercial liberty, and also that more
power might be conceded to themselves to deal with
this, the most important of all taxes. The fact that
in the “Form of Government” of 1772, it was left to
the Swedish king alone to decide on the tariff, and
that such decisions were included in the so-called
economic or administrative legislation, was due to the
idea that it was an especial privilege to trade with
other countries. The old kings protected foreign
merchants, and these paid for his protection. The
customs duties were then only a small part of the taxes
and revenues. The influence of the Estates was not
entirely excluded; and they voted several times for
special duties on articles of home consumption. As
regards Finland, the Emperor Alexander II., referring
in his speech from the throne in 1863 to the work
which was to he done by an organising committee,
declared that the general principles of the tariff should
be decided by himself in conjunction with the Estates.
But this was one of his good intentions which were
never carried out. Only on the tobacco duty has the
Diet been allowed to vote an increase several times, in
the same manner as it has voted an excise on brännvin
and malt.

Instead of recognising this natural and proper right
of the nation to vote its own most important tax, the
special Russian interests which rule in St. Petersburg
have now demanded concessions which would be greatly
to the disadvantage of Finland, and which might even
entirely destroy the present basis of the national
economy. There has already been an insecurity and
continual variation in the tariff without sufficient reason,
which has done harm to the industries of the country,
and which is not in accordance with good conservative
principles. It is not, as already noted, that the
Finlanders do not pay enough duty compared to Russia.
Here, as is frequently the case elsewhere, moderate
duties are much more productive of revenue than a
high prohibitive tariff. But if the Russian tariff was
introduced, imported articles would pay three times as
much. This whole amount would not be paid, because
less import would take place. But the present conditions 
of the national economy, and, in fact, of the
whole civilisation of the country, would be changed.
Instead of furthering civilisation, such a measure would,
without any necessity whatever, injure the life of the
people, and contribute to force it down to the same
low level as that of a great part of Russia’s inhabitants.
We need not refer to the inevitable demoralisation
which would follow; the smuggling which it would be
impossible to prevent on these cut-up coasts, where the
whole population knows and uses the sea as their great
highway, and which would be to the detriment of the
finances of Russia itself, as well as of its artificially
developed manufacturing industries. All the conditions 
for progress are here; the whole difficulty comes
whence it ought not to come, from the rulers in St.
Petersburg. It seems to be recognised that there are
many practical difficulties in the way of an immediate
revision of the Finnish tariff which would bring it up
to the Russian level, but it is reported that the plan of
increasing the tariff by such an enormous amount is
only postponed, partly till 1904, and partly till 1906,
when the privileges of Tammerfors come to an end.
That is to say, instead of the progress demanded by
justice and reason, the country is menaced with
economic destruction.

Besides the tariff of customs duties, there is another
public burden in regard to which a conflict has begun
with St. Petersburg. This is the question of military
service. The old Swedish organisation was excellent
in principle; it was the same as the English — that the
people were obliged to serve in case of necessity as
militia, but that the whole standing army should be
paid, both the army under the military tenure system
and certain corps induced to serve by direct payment
from the State. This freedom from obligatory military
service is in reality one of the main reasons for the
superior well-being and wealth of the people in England
and the United States. It is a great advantage, which
on the European continent is only held by the people
of Switzerland and until now partly in the Scandinavian 
countries; where, however, Denmark, having
had to fight with Germany, has instituted a short
obligatory service for all, and where Sweden has now
decided to follow her example, at even greater expense.

In Finland the army under the military tenure
system has, as we have mentioned, hardly been in
existence since the union with Russia. The
re-formation of Finnish regiments during the Crimean War was
an exception. Real military service, on the same lines
as in the Russian Empire, was however later desired
and enforced by the Russian authorities, and was
conceded. Except for important political reasons, it would
be impossible to understand how the enlightened and
extremely liberal men who led the Diet in Finland in 1878
tolerated the introduction of ordinary obligatory service
in place of the old order, which was superior in its
general principles. As was natural, some of the best
men, as, for instance, the late Baron S. W. von Troil,
were opposed to a system which implied that free men
who were drawn for service could be forced to a barrack
life which, instead of educating them, is too often
destructive to young men. But even if we had known
nothing at the time about the pressure brought to bear
on the Finnish nation, recent events would have taught
us why the new military law was then passed.

The military organisation then adopted was largely
an imitation of Prussia. The period of active service
was to be three years. Exemption was (and is) granted
to clergymen, school-teachers, physicians, sailors, and
pilots; also to certain others, such as only sons.
Young men who had gained a higher educational
standard could serve for shorter periods. Unlike
Germany, however, it was only a small number of men
who were taken for service with the colours. The
young men were distributed by lot between this
service and the reserve, so that till recently one-fifth
served in the active army in time of peace, <i>i.e.</i> 5600
men against 19,000 in the reserve. This reserve
required service from all, a total of ninety days’ service
during three years. The men who had served with the
colours must remain in the reserve for two years at
least. From the reserve all were transferred later
to the “landtvärn,” a territorial army which is only
mobilised in case of hostile attack, and in which all
had to remain until the age of forty, the time being
now some years longer. The old Swedish military oath
was changed, so that the soldiers promised “to defend
the throne and the fatherland,” which would mean
Finland. The military organisation was decided by
law, and voted by the Diet, and some of its provisions
were expressly declared to be part of the constitution,
after which declaration it cannot be changed except by
the consent of all four Estates on the proposal of the
Emperor. The conditions of military service and the
economic administration of the army, which were
included in this organisation, were dependent on the
Diet. The real military order depended on the Emperor
alone, and the commanding power was in the hands of
the Russian Minister of War, who, for this purpose, had
a bureau composed of Finnish officers. Nobody but
Finlanders could serve in the army.

This military organisation has not only been
attacked by the authorities in St. Petersburg, but the
scheme for a complete unification of the Finnish
military organisation with that of Russia has
undoubtedly been part of an attack on the whole Finnish
constitution. This military business was a point where
the constitutional rights of Finland were felt to be a
hindrance, and for this reason it was desired to do
away with the constitution itself. To those who know
Finland it was very curious to see the fear and ill-will
in St. Petersburg against the Finnish militia, the
reserve which is on active service for ninety days. It
was thought in St. Petersburg that such a national
militia might serve the people against their rulers.
All such ideas prove how little the rulers in St.
Petersburg know the Finnish people, with their ideas
of law and order and loyalty. They themselves have
hardly any idea of such order and cannot understand
how others can have it. The fact that the work of
this reserve is stopped, and that it is being entirely
done away with, is no great misfortune for the
Finlanders. It might not even be a great evil if
Finland should contribute money to the defence of
the country, instead of providing soldiers. But
nothing would be more entirely destructive to Finnish
life than the service demanded by the Russian Minister
of War, which included five years with the colours
in Russian regiments and under Russian officers and
non-commissioned officers. Those who know anything
about Finland and Russia, the entirely different
national temperament, the difference in habits of life,
and so forth, know what this would mean. Many
young Finlanders would not endure such a life. Their
whole present manner of life and work would be upset.
Finnish society would change its character. Already
many young Finlanders have emigrated, partly to
Swedish Norrland, chiefly to the United States and
to Canada, in order that they may avoid the present
hard three years’ service. Until recently emigrants
were few in number, it being more particularly those in
Ostrobothnia who, by their connection with Sweden
and Norway, had learned to emigrate; but this taste
and practice is extending. The danger of a new and
harder military service contributed at once greatly to
increase the emigration. For this reason the emigration 
increased in 1899 to over 12,000 according to
official figures (but really probably to 16,000) from an
average during the preceding years of about 3,000.
In some districts nearly all young men left the
country. If such a service, and especially a service
of three years in Russia and in a Russian corps, should
be introduced, the emigration of a majority of the
young men, which is now a local exception, would soon
become the rule. It would be on a still larger scale
than was the enormous emigration from Sleswick
when this country was transferred from Denmark to
Prussia, since the Russian service would be harder
than is the German service, and the habits of the
Finlanders and Russians differ even more completely
than those of the Danish peasants and Germans.

The Russian Council of State, in discussing the new
Army Bill, took due notice of several important points
in the counter-proposal made by the Finnish Estates
in 1899, but the advice of the Council has been
disregarded in the final decision in this matter. For the
now Military Service Law, which was signed by the
Emperor on July 12, and shortly afterwards was
promulgated by the Finnish Senate, makes no other
concession to the Finnish demands than lowering the
period of service with the colours from five years, as
originally proposed, to three years. The new law does
not recognise the existence of a separate Finnish
army; the existing Finnish regiments will be
disbanded, with the exception of the battalion of the
Finnish Guards and the regiment of Dragoons; and
there will be practically no difference between Finnish
and Russian regiments in garrison in Finland. Finnish
conscripts will be enrolled in Russian regiments, and
(contrary to the fundamental principles of Finnish
law) will be ordered to serve anywhere within Russia
or even abroad, and will be subject to the Russian
military penal code. Although the manifesto which
accompanies and serves as a kind of introduction to
the new law stipulates that “ for the time being,” <i>i.e.</i>
till 1903, when the new law will come into force, only
500 men shall be called out annually for service with
the colours (as against about 2000 under the existing
law), the new law leaves it entirely to the Russian
Minister of War to fix for the future the annual
contingent, subject only to the Emperor’s approval. The
Finnish Estates are thus entirely debarred from all
control over the contingent, a control so important for
the economical condition of the country. The manner
in which this new law has been enacted violates the
right of the Finnish people to legislate on military
questions, a right which was in the most emphatic
manner asserted by the Finnish Estates in 1899, and
fully recognised by the greatest European authorities,
including Professor Westlake in England.

Various of its provisions also entail serious alterations 
in existing Finnish laws, such as the Penal Code,
the sphere of the Law Courts, the rights of the
Communes, &c., which cannot be legally altered except
with the consent of the Finnish Estates.

An especially insidious and dangerous attack on the
whole constitution, and even on the existence of the
Finnish nation, is that Russians will receive
commissions in “the regiments, the ranks of which will be
preferably filled up by natives of Finland,” and will
thereby acquire the rights of Finnish citizens. Until
now it has been one of the great guarantees for the
national existence of the Finnish people that,
according to the constitution, only Finlanders can be Finnish
officials. Now, by a stroke of the pen, and against all
law, a class of Russian military officers is created who,
by their service in Finland, obtain some knowledge of
the country which thereafter may be used for work
which no Finlander would be willing to undertake.
But, above all, this ordinance, notwithstanding its
momentary leniency, is a new outrage on that legal
and constitutional order, without which no healthy
national life and no great material development is
possible. It creates and keeps alive an extreme
anxiety not only for national rights and national life,
but also for material welfare. What is not done
to-day may be done to-morrow. Without regard to
constitutional right, there is no guarantee for any
work or any order.

<chapter name="XI. The Government of Finland and its Future">
<h2><small>CHAPTER XI</small></h2>

<h2><small><small>THE GOVERNMENT OF FINLAND AND ITS FUTURE</small></small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> government of Finland is an instance of the fact
that a constitution matters less than the manner in
which it is used. The government has several
anomalies, but it has worked relatively well. Its
Senate has two sections, the Economic Department,
which coincides with the Cabinet or Ministry of other
countries; and the Judicial Department, which is
mainly a Supreme Court. Only in a few affairs, such
as when laws are prepared, do the two sections take
counsel together. This peculiar arrangement is no
great disadvantage to the country. The most anomalous 
feature in it is that the members of the Judicial
Department of the Senate, that is, of the Supreme
Court, hold their office as senators for only three years;
while all other judges, as well as other officials in
Finland, with a few well-defined exceptions, can only
legally be dismissed by a decision of the court. The
greatest practical defect in the organisation of the
government is its connection with the Emperor, the
medium between whom and his Finnish Cabinet is the
Governor-General, and more particularly the Minister-Secretary 
of State in St. Petersburg — the latter of
whom no longer has a committee for Finnish affairs at
his side as formerly, and for the moment is not even
as formerly, and as he ought to be according to law, a
Finlander. Much depends of course on the personal
character of the men. The four Estates who form the
Diet work in a manner which would hardly be thought
possible for so heavy and complicated a machine.
A procedure born of experience in Sweden has been
followed and improved upon. One feature of it is the
standing committees which prepare matters for the
Estates, and which continue to sit while the separate
Estates treat the matters sent up to them. Thus we
have the Law Committee, the Committee for Economic
and Industrial Questions, the Taxation Committee, the
Bank Committee, the Committee of Finance or of
Ways and Means, and the Committee for “Expedition”
or tabulating the results of the Diet. Another
important feature is the decision of matters which have
to be decided when the Estates do not agree and there
is not the usually necessary majority of three Estates
to one, or, in some of the cases which require the
unanimous decision of all four Estates, such as new
taxes, or fresh expenditure. Such questions are
decided by a two-thirds majority of the committee
which it concerns, and which is increased to a larger
body by each of the four Estates sending fifteen
representatives. It is especially the Finance
Committee which has to be “strengthened” in this
way, and has to decide questions in which there
is a difference of opinion between the Estates. This
is a feature which might be imitated with advantage
in certain other countries where the two houses too
often find it difficult to agree. The franchise for two
Estates, those of the citizens and the peasants, might be
made more liberal. In itself personal representation,
such as that of the heads of families who sit in the
House of Nobles, is, of course, against strict constitutional 
principles, but, like the English House of Lords,
Finland’s House of Nobles is a very liberal, capable,
and far from exclusive assembly. As in the case of
the bishops in the English House of Lords, practical
objections might be raised against the part played by
the clergy. But, on the whole, the Estates of Finland
have worked well, better than most of the modern
parliaments which are organised in a more rational
manner. It is desirable to extend their influence, as,
for instance, by more frequent sessions. According to
the constitution, they must meet at least every five
years; but even the three years’ interval, which has
been the recent period, was altogether too long,
especially for current affairs such as votes of supply and
appropriation of money. Nevertheless, after the session
of 1900, a four years’ interval was fixed by the
Emperor. Van der Vlugt, the great jurist of Leyden,
who calls the Finnish government “ideal,” or “next
to ideal,” during its liberal era after 1863, perhaps
speaks too strongly, but it is certainly a most
remarkable example of a liberal, progressive, and reforming
government, notwithstanding the lack of a democratic
and liberal election law, and the absence of what might
be considered even more necessary, a parliamentary
government with ministers changing according to the
majorities of the assemblies. Instead of “ideal,” we
will say that we see here a government proving how
much can be accomplished by sound and just ideas
notwithstanding great defects of organisation; and we
will add that, during a long period, the leaders here
were better men than has been the case in a good
many democratic countries.

The Senate, particularly the Economic Department,
works like the Cabinet in other countries. It has nine
divisions answering to the departments of ministers in
other countries: the Judicial division, the Civil and
Finance divisions, a division dealing with Audit, and
especially with taxation and the public domains, and
divisions known as Military, Church and Public
Instruction, Agriculture, Commerce and Manufactures,
and Means of Communication. Under the Senate and
under these divisions are the usual subordinate offices
of Prisons, Sanitary Board, Custom-House, Treasury,
Audit, Commissariat of War, Schools, Agriculture,
Surveying and Enclosure, Manufactures, Pilots, Post,
Railways, and the peculiar Finnish Committee for the
Preparation of New Laws. These last-mentioned offices
are managed partly by a board with joint control and
partly by one chief director. Their operations extend,
according to circumstances, over the different parts of
the country.

The local administration is still organised in a similar
manner to Sweden, the provincial governors answering
to the Swedish landshöfdings; in each härad or
hundred there is a collector having also other executive
authority, and with him an accountant to keep <i>inter
alia</i> the tax lists, and under him small local executive
officials with police and other duties. In Finland the
parishes are of more importance compared to the
härads than is the case in the Scandinavian countries.
The reason is supposed to be that there was not much
political organisation before the country was conquered
and converted to Christianity, when the parish system
was introduced.

A peculiarity of the Finnish administration, even of
the law courts, is the large part played by election in
the appointments. Besides the three Superior Courts
there are sixty-three local judicial districts or 
“Domsagor,” not entirely identical with the härads, of which
there are a larger number. The local judge, the
Häradshäfding or Domare, holds courts regularly
twice a year in each of the three or four districts
(“tingslag”) into which each Domsaga is divided.
This local judge is proposed by the Superior Court
and then nominated by the Finnish Senate or by the
Emperor, if the Governor-General thinks reference to
him necessary. The judge has at his side from seven
to twelve coadjutors (Nämdemän), nominated by the
court from among three candidates chosen for each
place by the general assembly of the parish or
commune. These coadjutors form a kind of jury, whose
opinion decides if they are unanimous; if not, the
judge has the decision. In the case of serious crimes,
however, the Superior Court always examines the
question. In the towns a Borgmästare (or two in
larger towns) is nominated from candidates selected by
the citizens. Where there are two, one of them has
the civil administration, the other is judge; but he
again has at his side two elected councillors. This
organisation is not perfect: and it is suggested, among
other matters, that the judicial element in the local
courts of the härads ought to be strengthened. But
it will readily be understood how such an organisation
helps to guarantee rights, justice, and liberty in
relation to the representatives of the government, both
central and local. Besides, we must not forget the
above-mentioned legal rule that no ordinary Finnish official
can be deposed for other reasons than specific misdoings
proved in court.

The Diets have lately wished to create and extend
communal life and representation, at first in the läns
or provinces, more recently in the härads.

The Lutheran clergy have one archbishop in Åbo
and three other bishops in Borgå, Nyslott, and Uleåborg,
chosen by the Emperor from three candidates elected
by secret votes by the pastors of the diocese. The
bishop is aided by a chapter formed by the dean and
two other members chosen for three years’ service
by the clergy of the diocese. The rural deans are
also elected by their fellow-clergymen. There are 900
pastors for more than 500 congregations belonging
to 366 parishes, each parish having usually two
pastors, one rector and a chaplain. The pastors are
mostly elected by the congregation from three
candidates sent to preach on trial by the chapter, and if
they are not satisfactory one more can be demanded.
A smaller number of pastors, in theory nominated
by the Emperor, are also really elected according to the
choice of the congregation. They are mainly paid in
kind. Every ten years a Synod of the Lutheran
Church meets, consisting of the bishops, thirty pastors
elected by their fellow-clergymen in the dioceses, a
member of the Senate, some jurists and professors of
the University, and forty-five lay representatives of the
congregations. All church laws must first pass this
Synod and can only be treated by the Diet and the
government afterwards. The affairs of the separate
congregations are decided by their assemblies, the
“kyrkostämma.”

The small Greek Orthodox Church, consisting of a
few congregations in the south-east who were allowed to
continue when Gustavus Adolphus gained this part of the
country, numbers about 40,000 persons. A few other
congregations exist at some other places where there
are a small number of orthodox people. The Orthodox
Church in Finland has its own Archbishop, and in
Church matters is under the Holy Synod in Russia.
In the towns, where there are a few Greek Catholics,
the Churches are, against the general rule in Finland,
maintained by the public treasury. For this reason
the contribution paid to the Orthodox Church by
the government is very considerable in proportion
to its small number of adherents. The most serious
complaint in relation to this Church is the prohibition
to leave it, and the compulsion put upon parents to
educate their children in the same confession. Such
compulsion is contrary to the laws of Finland, but
it does not seem that the Finlanders desire to raise the
question. Members of the Greek Orthodox Church
are often attracted by the more intellectual, instructive,
and educating character of the neighbouring Lutheran
churches, while their own Church is great in
ceremonial and legends. In some very few cases young
Lutherans are said to have left their own Church
for the Greek Orthodox confession because they could
not read, an art which is demanded by the Lutheran
Church as a condition of confirmation and thereby also
of marriage.

The present communal organisation is modern; in
the country it dates from 1865, in the towns from
1873; but old Swedish experience in self-government,
and the self-governing organisation of the Church, has
brought about a wide-reaching development of
communal life. Towns of over 2000 inhabitants elect
municipal councillors by votes, which are to a certain
degree of a value proportionate to the taxes paid by
the voters. Towns of 2000 inhabitants or less may
elect representatives if they so desire, and they
generally do so. The large country Communes have,
on the other hand, nearly always preferred to decide
matters in general assembly. The executive authority
and the ordinary administration is in the hands of a
committee chosen by this general assembly. Also the
towns have a committee of finance and several other
special executive committees. Such a communal
organisation necessarily gives considerable strength
to the national life.

It is unnecessary to speak here of the higher-class
schools and other institutions for instruction which are
now established in sufficient numbers, both for those
who speak Finnish and for those who speak Swedish.
They are founded by the State and by the Communes,
as well as by private persons who now receive
considerable subventions from the government. The teachers
are comparatively well paid. A great part of these
schools are common to boys and girls. In the private
elementary schools the girls form one-third of the
scholars. There is a happy variety of studies, and the
scholars have to a certain degree a free choice of
subjects. English is among the languages comparatively
little studied, and notwithstanding their intellectual
connection with Western Europe the Finlanders have
until now been little in touch with English thought,
literature, and language. To some extent, this is in
consequence of the necessity for learning both Swedish
and Finnish, and, in some cases, the foreign and very
difficult language of Russia. English is undoubtedly
at present as important as German and French.

Of the greatest importance, however, is the recent
organisation of the public elementary schools, and
especially their relations to the clergy. For several
reasons compulsory education has not been thought
desirable. The extent of the country makes it difficult
to enforce, and there was, too, a certain fear of
putting education, and with it the national life, into the hands
of public authorities. Neither was it really necessary
to introduce other constraint than the demand of the
Lutheran Church, that all young people must be able
to read if they want to be confirmed and married.
Except among sick, feeble, and abnormal children,
there are hardly any who do not know how to read.
Elementary instruction is mostly given at home, but
there are also elementary schools of different kinds
everywhere. The pastors take care as formerly that
such are established and maintained, and in their
capacity as directors of religious instruction they can
test the children’s ability to read. The lower-grade
schools are, however, largely only migratory, the teachers
only remaining a short time in each place; but there
are also permanent schools of this class, in which case
the beadles or vergers assist. In these schools religion
and reading are always taught, and generally arithmetic, 
writing, and some other subjects. The masters
and mistresses are partly educated in small seminaries
and partly manage without special education. The State
contribution to the schools is not very considerable;
regular subventions are only given to the Communes
in the Greek Orthodox districts of the south, where
the poverty of the peasants is given as a reason for
such assistance. Outside these parishes, however, the
State pays for the religious instruction of all Greek
Orthodox children. The elementary schools in Finland,
like many other departments, have, however, made
great progress since the time of Alexander II. The
law of 1866 ordered that seminaries should be
established for the education of teachers, and formulated a
programme for the so-called higher elementary schools
in town and country. Uno Cygnæus was the man
who did the best part of this work. The State was
obliged to help as soon as the Communes had done
their part, and the towns were at once compelled to
establish higher schools for the children. In the
country this was left to the decision of the Communes,
until in 1897 the Estates passed the law which now
obliges all Communes throughout the country to
establish within a period of ten years enough of these
higher schools to give instruction to all children
between nine and sixteen years of age. In other matters
the regulations of 1866 have been maintained. As
soon as the Communes or private persons procure a
house and furniture and educational appliances, and
give the teachers firewood, land, and grazing for a cow,
then the State gives a comparatively considerable
contribution to their salary — 800 marks for men, 600 for
women. The salary can be increased to 1200 and
900 marks. The rectors and chaplains may control
the religious instruction of these schools, but the
management is in the hands partly of inspectors, and
partly of a separate higher administration, in addition
to the elected local directors. The first seminary for
the education of teachers in these schools was established 
in the interior, at Jyväskylä, for Finnish-speaking 
young men and women; later, a number of other
seminaries have been added, especially in the towns
on the western coast, separate Finnish and Swedish
schools for men and women, as well as mixed schools.
In the higher elementary schools, reading, arithmetic,
and writing are taught; also history, geography, and
natural science, as well as designing and manual arts.
At present more than a seventh of the total number
of children are instructed in these schools. Private
persons have established some so-called “People’s High
Schools” for young, grown-up people of both sexes,
according to Danish models. The Russian Governor-General 
does not favour giving public subventions to
these schools.

In the schools, as in other spheres, women hold
very important positions in Finland. Their right to
dispose of money earned, also of property at marriage
or on coming of age, is not peculiar to Finland; but
there is hardly any country where women make similar
efforts to obtain education and work. Women of the
higher classes do as much as those of the lower classes.
The first lady obtained access to the University in
1870; in latter years more than one-fifth of the
young students are women. It is not yet usual for
women to hold high official positions, although they
may be elected members of school-boards and
committees of public assistance, but they work in every
department, and in many positions for which they are
better adapted than men. They are found in greater
numbers than men in the banks and public treasuries
as cashiers and accountants, and in the post and
telegraph offices. In the country the postal officials are
mostly women, and half of the teachers in the public
elementary schools are women. A great number are
now found in the liberal professions, the majority being
among the doctors.

Besides the great number of associations of different
kinds for agriculture and other branches of economic
life, and for scientific and artistic purposes, we may
here mention further the associations established
especially for spreading knowledge and education among
the people. The oldest of these is the Society for
Public Education, established in 1873, which is
especially engaged in spreading popular Finnish and
Swedish literature. There are further two societies
called “Friends of the People Schools,” one Finnish
and one Swedish, which establish and assist schools
where the local Finnish or Swedish population is
unable to do so itself. Not long ago the “Hemskola”
(Home School) was established, an organisation to
assist education in the home, which is already of
great importance in Finland, and in the present
situation is particularly interesting. Excellent pamphlets
and literary and educational material of various kinds
are now at the disposal of the smallest and most
distant homes of the large country districts. The
students contribute during the vacations to further the
great work of rural instruction and education. At the
University of Helsingfors an organisation has also
been established resembling the English University
Extension system, a movement which is now spreading
to many other countries. A great number of other
associations play an important part in the public
education and the general development of the people;
as, for instance, the numerous so-called young people’s
associations, and many of the already mentioned
associations of workmen. Also the temperance
associations and their great work must be
mentioned. In Finland, as in all Northern countries,
there is still a good deal of drunkenness, but the
preference of a large portion of the nation for
temperance, and even for total abstinence, which is the
reason why it is by no means common to find alcohol
in the farmhouses, is largely a consequence of the
organised work of such societies. The efforts on
behalf of public education by means of associations and
societies is not favoured or liked by the present
Russian Governor-General, especially at the present
moment; but the right of forming associations and
societies, notwithstanding the formal permission
required and usually asked for, has been regarded as
a part of the law. That this liberty of association
should have been now made dependent on the arbitrary 
will of the Governor-General, by decree of the
Emperor, is one of the causes of the present popular
discontent; it is regarded as neither legal nor just nor
wise.

The contest between the two languages, Finnish and
Swedish, has ended in equal rights for both; but as
late as 1850 the government was opposed to the
printing in Finnish of other books than those dealing
with religion and farming. The determination of the
Finns to have their language fully recognised was well
founded and necessary. The preponderance and even
exclusive use of the Swedish language in the schools
and in public life long after 1809 could not be admitted,
and the Finnish people undoubtedly had a right to full
national development. Only by means of their own
language could the people be fully educated, developed,
and strengthened. It would, however, be equally a
mistake to relegate the Swedish language to a
subordinate position. Those who speak Swedish are a minority
of between one-eighth and one-seventh of the whole
population; but a minority has its rights, and
furthermore it is unwise to break up the historical tradition
so long as this minority continues to represent an
essential part of the national literature and culture.
It is also a valuable means of communication with
general European civilisation that Swedish should
continue to be one of the national languages of Finland. The
efforts on behalf of the Finnish language have already
obtained equal rights for both languages in the political
and social world as well as in the schools; and
accordingly all officials must understand and be able to use
both Finnish and Swedish.

To make Russian the official language for the
higher administration, as has now been ordered, is,
on the other hand, not only against the present law,
but is unnecessary, unjust, and a hurtful and
detrimental burden on the people. In reality there
is no Russian population in Finland. Of a total of
2,700,000 persons there are 8000 of whom Russian
is the native tongue. To Russianise a people who
are so advanced in civilisation and education as the
Finns is of course an utter impossibility in our times;
but that a part of the people, and especially of the
educated classes, should be obliged to use the Russian
language without any necessity, and without thereby
obtaining the least good, is intolerable, and so much
the less tolerable because the country has already two
languages (and languages so fundamentally different
as Finnish and Swedish) which all educated persons
must learn and use. To make Russian the official
language, contrary to the laws of the country, is
another reason for discontent; and instead of
attracting a greater number of Russians, it will render their
position in the country more difficult, and finally
impossible.

The position of the press in Finland is one of the
darkest features of its modern public life. Like all
well educated nations in the North, where the winter
nights are long, the Finlanders read much. In the
autumn of 1899, before the late attack on the press
had taken place, there were ten Swedish and
thirteen Finnish daily papers, and a total of eighty-two
Swedish, one hundred and forty Finnish, and four
mixed periodicals. Now a number of dailies and
political weeklies have been suppressed. In the liberal
period under Alexander II. it was of course intended
to introduce legal rights for the press. From 1865
to 1867 a press law was even in force, but as the
Estates did not agree with the government about
certain restrictions the provisional law went out of
force. There was then a return to the former system
of “preventive” censorship, so that a paper can be
censored and forbidden before the printing. In the
last few years, since the present Governor-General
came to Finland, press restrictions have become
intolerable. Notwithstanding the control exercised by
the preventive censorship, numerous papers have been
suppressed in a most arbitrary manner, and without
respect to the rights of property and work of those
concerned in them. In fact, there is at present
hardly any legal order maintained in the matter. It
is of course impossible to keep communications of a
political character from a nation so advanced as the
Finlanders, and the efforts to do this only make the
ideas and their expression sharper and more bitter.

The tendency of thought in Finland has one
peculiarity, which probably has some relation to the
mixed nationality of the nation. The mass of the
people is greatly influenced by the Lutheran clergy,
who still exercise much of the educational and moral
influence which has always been characteristic of the
Protestant religion. The upper classes in Finland, on
the other hand, continue to follow even more than in
most other countries (excepting the great leading
nations) the liberal movement which is common to the
whole civilised world. The Swedes have always done
this to a greater degree than any other of the small
nations, having become very cosmopolitan since their
participation in the great religious fights of Europe;
and their share was not least during the liberal period
at the end of the eighteenth century before Finland’s
separation from Sweden. At present the Finnish
upper classes are probably more cosmopolitan and
intellectually liberal than the Swedes; for with their
mixed nationality they more readily learn other
languages and the ideas of other nations. The ideas
of life vary in different classes of the Finnish people, the
masses being strongly religious, the upper class
comparatively liberal; but, like Englishmen, they are united in
concerning themselves more with the practical work of
life, and less with theories and sentiments which lack
a goal.

It must not be forgotten that Finnish legal 
organisation and methods are still in use in ordinary civil
matters. There is the same security, the same forms
of justice and law, civil and criminal, as in other
civilised countries. And the ordinary Finnish official
holds to the law and legal methods as closely as his
foreign <i>confrère</i>, the whole class being remarkable for
its honesty, and bribery being almost unknown. The
corruption prevailing in some other countries,
backward in civilisation and in the maintenance of legality
and public morals — a corruption which undermines
law and makes good order next to impossible — is
unknown in Finland. In proportion to the force of
such ideas about individual and social morality, the
lack of security in public law, and the doubt whether
it is the law which is supreme or personal arbitrary
will, is the more keenly felt. Already the danger which
exists and the anxiety which is felt about it are
burdens on the whole of social life, the material as
well as the intellectual.

Our study has shown where the Finnish people
stand in regard to material development. We have
seen the great progress made, and further that which
is designed; but we have also seen enough to know that
the country is still far from being a rich country. In
a report of the committee for the drafting of Bills we
find a calculation of the national capital about the
year 1890. The total amount of private fortunes
was then calculated at about 2200 million marks, or
2396 millions without deduction of 181 millions of
debts due from one person to another. The items
were 1464 millions of real estate, 36 millions in
merchant ships (one ton reckoned as worth 500 marks
for the steamers, 100 marks for the sailing ships),
164 millions as the value of domestic animals, 56
millions for the fixtures of the farmers, 311 millions
for household articles, 173 millions for stored goods,
65 millions for movable machines and implements,
57 millions of cash of all kinds, and finally 60 millions
as debts due from the State or other public institutions
to private parties; in all, private persons’ movable
capital, 922 millions. These values, showing an average
of less than 1000 marks per head, are of course now
much higher, but they were (and are) low compared to
a good many other countries. In Great Britain and
Ireland the value of all property was reckoned a
few years prior to 1890 at 7000 francs per head;
for Holland about the same; Belgium a little less;
France about 6000; Germany under 4000; Denmark
about 4000; Norway hardly 1500; Sweden, according 
to different calculations, about 2000; for the
poorer countries of southern Europe rather more, even
as much as 1800 francs for Italy, and still larger
amounts, if we are to believe statistics, for Greece and
for some of the countries of the Balkan Peninsula.
In several respects it is of interest to compare Europe
with the United States. The census of 1890 in the
United States showed an average of 6000 francs per
head, or about the same as in France. On the same
level as Finland we find only the poorer of the old
slave States, of which some sank below $200, or 1000
francs per head. The total property of the
northwestern States, among whose inhabitants there are so
many men from northern Europe, averaged from 5000
to 10,000 francs per head, the same amount as in the
rich north-eastern States. California even rose to
between 10,000 and 15,000 francs, and some of the
new mining States to over 15,000. Australia was
not much below 10,000; Canada up to 5000; and
Argentina about 3000. As we have said, Finland is
only in the early stage of wealth-production.

The advance of Finland, however, is satisfactory;
and, among many other facts, what is known about
the distribution of incomes in the cities proves her
progress. Dr. Heikki Renvall tells us of the results
of the income-tax, which continues to be levied in the
towns; and especially results coming from the larger
towns during the period 1875-99. We find here that
the number of taxpayers progresses more rapidly than
the total population. In Helsingfors, where the same
classes were taxed from 1885-99, there is in these
years an increase of 88 per cent, against an increase
in the number of the people of 81½ per cent.; in Åbo
101 against 22; in Tammerfors, 286 against 120½;
in Viborg, in spite of the fact that a larger part of the
people now live outside the town, 58 against 25. It is
particularly the smaller class of taxpayers which has
increased very considerably, while, at the same time, a
larger number of those who have been small taxpayers
go into the more prosperous classes. This upward
movement is the reason why the lowest class in 1890
was composed of two-thirds men and one-third women,
and in 1899, on the contrary, one-third men and
two-thirds women. The men obtain larger incomes, but
the women rise to be taxpayers. This progress is in
accordance with all the other facts we have noticed.

The information gained from the movement of the
population is of the same character. Finland holds
here, too, a favourable place in the ranks of the
nations. There is a considerable excess, 1.5 per cent.,
of births over deaths, the same as in other first-class
countries, and a comparatively large number of children
are born to each marriage. People marry early; there
are, however, numerous unmarried people. The poor
living, still common in the country, sour bread, sour
milk, and strongly-salted meat and fish, does not
result in a very great number of deaths. The average
duration of life is not low, but a considerable number
of persons die relatively early; the probable duration
of life is therefore not high. The number of deaths
among small children is not high compared with other
countries, as for instance Southern Germany or the big
Russian towns or provinces in interior Russia, where
between one-third and one-fourth of all children in
their first year die, not the least conspicuous cause of
which is the rule for fasting of the Greek Orthodox
Church. Finland shows in some parts a result less
favourable than the general result, as for instance in
the number of deaths among children in the neighbourhood 
of St. Petersburg, where many mothers leave their
children to become wet-nurses in the large city; and
also on the coast of Ostrobothnia, where we are less
certain of the reason; it may be connected with the
great prominence of salted fish in the food, or to
emigration or other causes. The number of deaths
is least among the wooded hills in both the western
and eastern interior. The land is possibly more
healthy here, where it is better drained by
rapidly-running streams; also plenty of money is earned here
in the woods. All these figures, marriages, births, and
deaths, vary of course with the influence of good and
bad years; showing for instance the fearful effects of
a famine such as that in 1867, and the particularly
good situation at the period of the great lumber export
in the first part of the seventies, and showing again
considerable progress during the last few years.

Another result shown by the above-mentioned work
of Dr. Renvall is that it is particularly the industrial
and commercial classes who are progressing, and whose
numbers and incomes are increasing. The middle-class, 
with permanent incomes as officials or in similar
occupations, have not advanced in the same degree.
Whether we look at the great progress of the lower
classes, or at the larger number of men who now
obtain considerable wealth, we see to what extent free
industry is being developed. This is fortunate.
Referring to the considerable means in the hands of the
men who lead the economic development of Finland,
it ought not to be left unnoticed that, except in
England and the United States, there is hardly any
country in which wealth is less employed for the
gratification of personal pleasure and enjoyment.
Nearly all the rich men of Finland continue to
employ their means to advance the economic development 
of the country and for purely public purposes;
just as in England and the United States.

It might be supposed that those who are at the
head of the government would feel it an honour to
do all that is possible for the progress of the country.
With the popular sense of legal order and its
genuinely conservative character, the political life of the
country might also have improved. There might
have been a fuller co-operation of the Estates with the
government as regards the tariff for instance, or in
more frequent sessions of the Diet, or by an extended
election franchise, and in several other ways. We
will not speak here of the press, a necessity and a
great help to a nation in the stage of civilisation which
the Finlanders have reached. However much is done
here for economic progress, as well as for popular
education, more might be done. It is noticeable that
the Finlanders, like other new nations, have among
them a number of men who are not only good but
genuinely enthusiastic workers for the public welfare.
These men ought to have the largest possible scope
for their activity. We have referred to the poor North
as not yet even completely known, full of great natural
difficulties, but still with considerable possibilities;
and where access, for instance, to the ice-free northern
ports would be of importance. In various ways the
rulers might assist the honest, patient, tenacious, and
sometimes really heroic efforts of the people. We
need not lay stress on the absolute necessity for a
national, independent and free development. Those
rulers are in reality the strongest, and accomplish the
most, who work with their people. And no people are
more willing to co-operate heartily with their rulers
than the Finns.

We all know the saying of Montesquieu that those
countries are the richest which are the best governed,
and not those which have the best natural conditions.
It is, however, less true now than formerly. At
present the central government in the most highly
developed country has less influence than formerly,
compared to local administration, and especially to the
free efforts of individuals. In the United States we
have seen parts of the country, especially some large
cities, which have had the very worst administration,
but where the whole situation and the general progress
has thereby been influenced only in a small degree. Like
hard natural conditions, a bad government may, in some
respects, even be a stimulus. Still the influence of
the government must always be enormous for good or
for evil in a country like Finland.

As regards the present situation, we are
compelled to ask, not only what good the government
might do, but also what power of resistance the people
have against its evil acts. In some respects the
people had no need of modern arts to be able to
resist. This is the case where it is a question of the
conservation of nationality, and especially of language.
It has been well said that the Finns, who for more than
seven hundred years have not been made Swedish, during
centuries when progress was much slower, and when
the liberal character of the Swedish government did
not provoke any great resistance, have no need to fear
being Russianised. Much intellectual national life
will continue, notwithstanding all that may be done by
the rulers. And to quell a national life, intellectual
and economic, such as is now found in Finland, is
an utter impossibility.

The bad effects which might follow such an attempt
are best seen when we consider the possible acts of
the rulers against the rights and welfare of the people.
Let us suppose that the young Finlanders should
really be compulsorily enrolled for military service in
Russia. The Polish insurrection of 1863 began when
the Russians tried to prevent a national movement,
and ordered that the young men should be carried off
at night for military service in Russia. It was then
that these young men fled to the woods and really
rebelled. Such an event would not take place in
Finland; yet there is no doubt that a very great
number, and indeed the best, of Finland’s youth would
emigrate to found a new fatherland rather than serve
as soldiers in the Russian army. A Russian customs
tariff would not make it absolutely impossible to live
in Finland; it might improve certain industries in
an artificial manner and at the expense of the people,
but it would cause a fearful depression in the whole
manner of living, and would be a hindrance to
progress, public health and well-being, as well as an
immense burden on the natural industries of the
country, agriculture, exploitation of the forests and all
connected therewith, and most of the manufactures
which are really indigenous to the country, not to
speak of commerce and navigation. The United
States could make great progress notwithstanding a
bad tariff, because they form a continent which is
largely self-sufficient, and where the wealth of one
part assists the making of wealth in other parts.
Finland would be separated for economic purposes
from the more civilised countries, and bound to the
poverty-stricken, artificially-isolated, and oppressed
Russia. The worst influence is of course exercised
in material, intellectual, and moral respects by the
destruction of order, by illegal decrees, and
unconstitutional acts and procedure. Justice is
necessary for all social and individual life, for labour,
capital, and for life itself. Here is the great question
of the future of the country. The people may suffer
but they will not submit, and it seems impossible that
the proceedings taken by some of the rulers in St.
Petersburg can be continued, and that the Russian
bureaucracy can be allowed to destroy its weaker but
more successful neighbour. We would rather
suppose that the supreme rulers will at last listen to
the demand of law, justice, and wisdom; since it is
evident that nobody, least of all the Russian people,
would gain profit or honour by breaking the law and
oppressing the honest Finnish nation.
