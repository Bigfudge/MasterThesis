<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<sc>This</sc> book was published in October, 1888, while the
translator was in Copenhagen. The great interest taken
at the present time in the literature of Russia and in
everything which relates to that great country makes
all that aids in giving a correct impression of its
political and social condition specially acceptable. Dr.
Brandes is a shrewd observer of what he sees, and
has an established reputation as an acute literary critic.
During his lecturing tours he came in contact with the
leading men of St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Warsaw.
The brighter aspects of the Russian problem are
incorporated in this volume, while his work on Poland
contains the more sombre picture of the oppression to
which that country has been subjected.

The translator desires to express his obligations to
Professor Rasmus B. Anderson, late United States
Minister to Denmark, for his advice and assistance, as
well as to the author, who is himself thoroughly
conversant with the English language and literature.

<chapter name="Introduction">
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

*

<sc>The</sc> cause of my trip to Russia in 1887 was an
invitation by the Russian Authors’ Association in St.
Petersburg to deliver a course of lectures in French. They
proposed to make all the arrangements, if I would give
one-fourth of the receipts to their poor-fund.

While I was in St. Petersburg, I received a similar
invitation from Count Kapnist, the curator of the
university in Moscow, who also asked for the same portion
of the receipts for the benefit of the poor students.
On my way to St. Petersburg I also visited Helsingfors.
After my lectures in Moscow, I spent some time in a
villa in Central Russia, twenty hours’ journey by rail
south of Moscow. From there I went to Smolensk, and
from Smolensk to Warsaw.

Thus in three months I became acquainted with widely
separated parts of the country, and some of the most
important of this great empire. I had the opportunity
of observing both city and country life. I saw Russia
both in winter and summer garb. The peculiar
conditions under which I travelled brought me in connection
with several hundred people of different races and of
different classes in society; I met residents of Great
and Little Russia, Finns and Swedes, Armenians and
Poles, of both sexes, and was brought into close relations
with fashionable and common people, conservatives and
liberals, lawyers and doctors, authors and artists, princes
and professors, journalists and peasants, officials and
menials.

Although I am giving my impressions, I do not for a
moment forget how imperfect must be my description of
the Russian Empire in its entirety. I am not
unmindful of how little of what I did see I was able to
understand fully, nor of how inconsiderable a portion of a
country like Russia and of its inhabitants was placed
before me. But naturally I believe in my capacity for
observation and in the soundness of my judgments.

<h2>IMPRESSIONS OF RUSSIA.</h2>

*

<h2><small>I.</small></h2>

<sc>Alexander von Humboldt</sc>, in order to give a
forcible illustration of the immense extent of the Russian
Empire, once compared it to the moon. If you look at
the moon when it is full, you see in the hemisphere of
the satellite which is before you a smaller territory than
that of Russia. About fifty thousand square miles are
still wanting.

No other country has so large an extent of territory
in one division. It is one-sixth part of the area of the
land of our globe, and, although sparsely inhabited, has
a population of about ninety-seven million souls, of
whom sixty-seven millions are of Russian lineage.

So far as inanimate nature is concerned, the situation
of the Russian Empire corresponds to its immense size.
Boundless plains extend from the German frontier far
into Central Asia, and from the extreme north to the
Black Sea. In one of its remote quarters are the
mountains of Caucasus, which rise, from a level lower than that
of the ocean, to a height far above the highest of the
European Alps. In the northwest, it has the largest lakes of
Europe, the Ládoga and the Onega, and in the south,
the Caspian Sea, the largest in the world. Finally, its
rivers are as vast as its plains, its mountains, and its
lakes. The largest of them, the Volga, is the longest
and widest river in Europe. Although it does not
discharge so large a volume of water as might be expected,
and as the Danube does, for example, yet that is on
account of the flatness of the country and the scantiness
of the rainfall. Just as whole streams in Southern
Russia are swallowed up by the earth and evaporated as they
flow, so the immense flood of the Volga, pouring into the
basin of the Caspian Sea, has not sufficed in a hundred
years to raise the water level.

The great steppes, which have been compared to the
ocean, have none of the ever varying aspects of the sea.
Unchanging uniformity is their characteristic. The
greatest river, which is as broad as a sound, and in
comparison with which the Rhine is short, lacks the
impetuosity and turmoil of less imposing rivers. A certain
mighty sluggishness is peculiar to its flow. This
sluggishness as well as this uniformity is Russian.

In this empire, where everything is immense, there is
nothing in the natural conditions which is mild or
temperate. This great tract of land is like a body without
limbs. It has no indentations of any consequence; is
not cut up into half-island formations or divided into
islands, like the whole of Northern, Western, and
Southern Europe. It has a continental climate: that is, long,
severe winters and burning summers. The ocean, which
always tempers the cold and heat, is remote; and the
influence of the Gulf Stream, always softening, is not felt
here.

Just as this immense continent has no indentations,
so is its uniformity unbroken by either mountains or
valleys. This land of forests, black mould, and steppes
is one great plain. This is the reason why the cold
blasts from the Arctic Ocean sweep down over the whole
empire without meeting any obstruction, and why the
moisture is wanting which the Atlantic Ocean and the
Baltic and Mediterranean Seas give to Europe. With
the exception of the Crimea and Caucasus, no part of
this broad land has a southern climate. As some one
has expressed it, Russia has a summer but no south.

It is quite true that there are very great extremes in
this homogeneous climate. The average summer
temperature on the northern coasts of Russia (37° Fahr.) is
lower than the winter temperature in Sevastopol. But
January in Odessa has the same temperature as January
in Christiania; and although Moscow is on the same
degree of latitude as Copenhagen and Edinburgh, the
average winter temperature is 10° Fahr. in the Russian
city, 33° in the Danish, and 38° in the Scotch.

Yet there is hardly any real difference between the
natural conditions of European Russia and Siberia
except the greater severity.

From that region, in the north, where only the
reindeer can exist, to that country, in the south, which
produces the grape and Indian corn, there is in European
Russia a gradual transition; yet to the Western-European
neither the vegetable nor the animal life presents
anything unfamiliar or extraordinary. Both the plants and
animals that are common with us are found in the larger
part of the empire. Of wild beasts there are found
some bears in all the forests, while both in the forests
and on the grassy plains and some of the steppes there
are wolves in great numbers. The number of wolves in
European Russia is estimated to be about 175,000. These
wolves destroy annually 180,000 head of cattle, 560,000
sheep, 100,000 dogs, besides 150 human beings. Each
wolf is estimated to consume annually the value of about
80 rubles.

Except this one wild beast, however, there is no
dangerous or uncommon animal. While the inorganic world
in this land is on a grand scale, the vegetable and animal
products are the reverse. The trees, even in the forests,
are not tall, and the whole animal world has no striking
feature.

The decidedly essential feature which characterizes
Russia is uniformity notwithstanding the immensity of
everything. Although the country is enormously large,
it is monotonous. Russia is a land not only of
far-reaching plains, long and broad rivers, uniform climate, but
also of regular geological formation. This immense
country also constitutes one organic unit, since the
woodland cannot do without the grain-land, the grain-land
without the steppes, nor the steppes without the
woodland. The steppes need the trees, and the woodland
needs the cattle. And so also the country near the
coast feels the want of the interior, and the interior of
the coast. As Count Moltke has said, in his “Letters
from Russia,” “No part can do without the other: the
forests of the north cannot dispense with the
grain-producing south, nor can the industrious interior spare
either of the other parts.” The vision that this great
empire will be broken up into a number of small
kingdoms will therefore hardly be realized. What nature
has united geographically, man cannot separate; and
what it has separated, man cannot unite. The
geography of the country, which has prevented the union of
the three Scandinavian nations into one, keeps this sixth
part of the earth together.<footnote>A. Leroy-Beaulieu: “The Empire of the Tsars and the Russias,”

<chapter name="II">
<h2><small>II.</small></h2>

<sc>Russia</sc> is an agricultural country. There are
comparatively few cities. The provincial towns all resemble
one another. When you have seen one or two, you know
them all. Such a provincial town has a public park, a
cathedral, a governor’s palace, and a hospital. So much
is essential; the remainder depends on the better or
worse condition of the inhabitants. Still, there is one
and a very important thing you are sure to find—a
prison,—and in a country town like Lomja, which has a
population of twenty-five thousand, there is one with
six hundred inmates.

Life in such a Russian country town, on a clear
summer day, however little it may be praised by native
authors, sometimes appears very attractive. The gay
costumes, the red shirts of the men and the embroidered
jackets of the women, shine brightly in the sun. Of those
which I have seen, Briansk, a manufacturing town on
the river Diesna, was a type of the Russian monotony.
On the other hand, Smolensk<footnote>Pronounced Smahlyensk, with the accent on the last syllable.</footnote> is delightfully
situated on both banks of the Dnieper. The larger part of
the town is on the left bank, which has a steep descent
to the river, so that the numerous domes and spires of
the churches, seen from the opposite side, appear
towering over the landscape in strong relief. The general
situation, however, on account of the flatness of the land,
is not attractive, and the town, therefore, is only
interesting to the traveller as a commercial and manufacturing
town or for the historical associations, like all the towns
which Napoleon’s winter campaign has made renowned.
The intellectual life in these provincial towns presents a
sad picture: it is cards and brandy, brandy and cards.

With the exception of Finland, Poland, and the
provinces on the Baltic, each of which has its own character,
all the intellectual life in Russia is concentrated in the
two capitals, St. Petersburg and Moscow.

At the very moment when the traveller at the frontier
takes the Russian railway train, there are three things
which meet him like messages from a strange world:
the language, which, with its rich and soft melody, has
not the least resemblance to any of the Western-European
tongues; the alphabet, of which some of the characters
are new to us and others have a different meaning than
in ours (as, for instance, H is used for N); and finally a
computation of time, which tears you away from your
customary almanac by rolling the time back for twelve
days, and thereby burns the bridge to the civilization
of Western and Southern Europe. Would that it were
only in these twelve days that Russia was behind the
rest of Europe!

St. Petersburg is generally the first place visited by
the traveller. St. Petersburg is, as said by Peter the
Great in his old comparison, the window which the
creator of modern Russia built towards the west. It must
be conceded that for by far the largest part of the year
the view through the window is obscured by frost
flowers. What Russia most needed in that time was an open
port. Archangel, in the north, was almost continuously
closed by ice. Kronstadt was added, but that also is
shut up for half the year. Since then the empire has
gained new harbors, such as Vladivostok, in the far east,
but not one of them is free from ice. Only from the
ports on the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof is navigation
almost always free, but these do not afford Russia free
approach to the outside world, since vessels can always
be stopped at the Dardanelles, so long as Constantinople
is in the possession of the Turk. This accounts for the
constant and ever increasing desire of Russia to possess
Constantinople.

By the founding of St. Petersburg the Tsar desired
to bring his country nearer to the west. The city, as has
been said, was at once a symbol of his determination
and the means for its execution. Although at the same
time he allowed a canal to be constructed between the
Neva and the Volga, he strove to force the wealth of the
land from the east and south up against the current,
and to open an outlet for it to the west.

St. Petersburg is a city intersected by an enormous
number of canals and streams; it is built in a swamp
and surrounded by a desert. It is an artificial city,
without any country naturally tributary, and it derives the
most of its support from officials and soldiers, although
its trade and manufactures are of late more important.
It is an unhealthy city, in which, as in the old capital of
the empire also, the number of deaths is so much larger
than the number of births that the population, suffering
a loss of one or two thousand a year, would die out, were
it not for a constant immigration. It is a half-educated
city, in which, at the present time, three hundred
thousand of the nine hundred thousand inhabitants cannot
read or write. Finally, it is a beautiful city, in grand
style, with half European and half barbarian splendor.

For the foundation of this city in the five years from
1712 to 1716, Peter the Great caused more than one
hundred and fifty thousand workmen to be brought into the
Neva swamp, where the most of them died of fever,
contagious diseases, or hunger. To compel the masons to
seek employment in this place only, he prohibited the
erection of stone houses in the whole empire, under a
penalty of confiscation of property and banishment to
Siberia, and also commanded every nobleman who owned
more than thirty peasant families to build a house in
this new capital, the situation and size of which were
exactly determined as the conditions of the individuals
brought them under one or another class of
householders. Perhaps in remembrance of what he owed to
Holland, he gave to the city, when it was built, his name in
its Dutch form, <i>Piterburg</i>.

It has developed into a city of luxury, where the
number of servants in proportion to the number of the
inhabitants exceeds that of any other city in Europe. In
1870 the number of families in Berlin which had three
domestics was two per cent of the whole number, in St.
Petersburg it was twelve per cent; and for that year the
percentage of families in Berlin having eleven domestics
was not given, but the number of such families in St.
Petersburg was one per cent.

Driving from the railway station into St. Petersburg,
you constantly expect to see the Neva before you—St.
Petersburg and the Neva being so closely connected in
our minds. But no! this is only a canal, and that only the
river Fontanka, which empties into the Neva. Finally,
the mighty stream lies before you, broad as an arm of
the sea, ice-bound and covered with snow, between the
tall quays and the islands, on one of which towers the
fortress of Petro-Pavlovsk, with its gilded spire
glistening in the sun. Then a world of reddish yellow
palaces is disclosed, which, like all the Russian
government buildings, awaken surprise by their wonderful
color, being partly suggestive of a prison hue and partly
of a flesh tint.

Before the Winter Palace the stranger is startled by
the sight of a strange, ugly iron shed, which disfigures
the beautiful square. This shed, however, gives a
correct impression of the climate of the country. It is as
necessary as the palace, even more necessary. In the
middle of it there is a huge caldron, which in winter
nights is filled with glowing coals so that the coachmen
and servants, while waiting for their masters in the
palace, may not freeze to death.

Here on the left bank of the Neva are also the huge,
gay-colored buildings of the Admiralty, and St. Isaac’s
Church, built wholly of granite and marble. And here
also the stranger first comes in contact with the
propensity of the Russian to work out his results by the aid
of the strength and the richness of the material, rather
than by the beauty of the design. In the interior, the
floor and walls are covered with polished marble of
different kinds: there are columns of lapis-lazuli, sixteen
or seventeen feet high, and of malachite, thirty feet
high, with gilded bases and capitals; but there are no
forms that impress themselves on your memory. Great
art first meets the eye when it dwells on Falconet’s bold
memorial Peter the Great, where the Tsar is seen
galloping up a block of Finnish granite on a rearing
horse—perhaps the best equestrian statue of modern times. There
are also along the Neva a large number of fine buildings
in the Italian and French style, transplanted here. There
are also very numerous chapels and shrines, before
which every passer-by crosses himself again and again,
in case he does not stop and say his prayers. On the
Neva and on the quays there is a constant succession of
sleighs. These sleighs, public or private, have only a
single seat, for two persons, generally a gentleman and
a lady, and the man and woman sit in such a manner
that he always has his arm about her waist, — probably
to prevent her being thrown out.

Everybody drives, even the servants who are sent
about the city. The distances are so great that, as a
rule, it is necessary, and there are twenty-five thousand
public coachmen at command. People bargain about
the price of every trip; and in the outset, when the
stranger imperfectly understands Russian, nothing is
more common than this conversation: “What do you
ask?”—“Fifteen kopecks.”—“Not at all! I will not
give more than twenty-five.”

We drive from here to the Nevski Prospekt, on a day
in early spring, with pure, clear air and sun. The driver
is a Russian peasant. During the summer he cultivates
his land, but in the winter he earns his bread as
<i>izvoshchik</i>. He sits there, with his face covered with beard,
under a low-crowned hat, in a long and loose coat, which
from the waist down is shaped like a wide, puckered shirt
or a loose dressing-gown, and extends quite down to the
feet. He wears an embroidered scarf about the waist.
Strange to say, in the museum at the Hermitage, among
the antiquities found in the earth at Kertsh, in the
Crimea, on the ornaments like bracelets, are to be found
figures of bearded Scythians, who in physiognomy, as
well as in dress, remind one of these peasant coachmen.
The type seems to have prevailed ever since.

It is a genuine scene of a great city, this Nevski
Prospekt in the sparkling sunlight, with three and four rows
of carriages side by side, in an endless procession.
Elegant men and women are in the carriages. On the
sidewalks are the less wealthy people, the women wrapped up
like mummies for fear of the cold,—although the worst
of it is over,—and apparently wholly unable to dress
becomingly. The impression made by most of them is
trivial and insignificant, but the appearance of some who
have striven to be noticed for their dress arrests the
attention. I recall such a one in a glaring costume of
light green velvet, shining like a scarabæus, and another
in a bright yellow velvet dress with embroidery down
the back. Some of the coachmen look like genuine
barbarians, being dressed in red and gold; those of the
foreign ministers have a triangle in gold embroidery on
the back and the colors of the country on the front of
the hat. Our coachman and all coachmen cross
themselves on the forehead, the mouth, and the breast before
every shrine and before every one of the numerous
chapels from whose burning lamp a light is thrown into the
street. Most of this comes from habit. There is far
less piety than there would seem to be from all the
crossing and bowing, in the open streets, to which the stranger
is a witness. While they are making the sign of the
cross with the right hand, they are scratching themselves
on the back with the left.

Some of the men have extremely expressive
countenances. Almost all the women have chlorosis. The
climate compels them to sit too much indoors. The
water is undrinkable and the food bad. The poorer
people live on barley bread, cabbage soup, and porridge in
this land whose temperature demands more nutritious
food than in England. And the national drinks—tea,
kvas, and vodka (brandy)—have not the nutriment of
Germany’s lighter or England’s stronger ales. In St.
Petersburg anæmia is met everywhere.

Life in the principal streets is quite modern. But in
the middle of the Nevski, near the Kazán Church, behind
the memorial of Catherine the Second, you look into the
Gostinny Dvor, bazaars with arcades, stall against stall,
a spectacle which is anything but modern. You catch a
glimpse of old Russia in the bearded peasant (<i>muzhik</i>)
with his bast shoes, and his patched caftan or sheepskin,
and then you see the priests in brown robes, reaching
to their feet, a black cap over their long hair, and with
an embroidered belt to which the beard almost reaches.
They trade with the merchant, who stands there in
antique Russian fur cap, while his wife, with real pearls
about her neck, stands by and listens.

Nevertheless, if you really wish to see old Russia you
must go to Moscow. It is easily done; for, though St.
Petersburg and Moscow are two separate worlds, it is
arranged by the modern means of conveyance that by
leaving the first in the afternoon the other is reached
the next morning. The two capitals are united by the
only really express train in Russia.

On the more elevated land in the interior, surrounded
by a wall which here and there rises into towers with
green roofs, lies a city which, in its different quarters,
alternately possesses the characteristics of a great
capital, a provincial city, and a country town. Here there
are fine streets, with tall houses and passages, as in Paris,
and there interminable ranges of low houses with
spacious gardens. You can drive from this fine quarter
into one which is almost wholly without pavements. In
some places, it is like the country in this city of eight
hundred thousand inhabitants and four hundred churches.
There is open ground enough, but hardly any place
where people can walk,—no promenades except in the
outskirts. Yet everything is laid out on a broad scale;
everything has the stamp of repose, just as in St.
Petersburg everything seems to be planned for keen and
immediate enjoyment.

Here the traveller would think he was on the highway
into Asia. Strange sights are to be seen: a Tatar
wedding-party in modern carriages; dark countenances, under
turbans, in elegant European landaus. That was the
sight which first met me in Moscow. Everything is to
be seen here which we are accustomed to imagine as gay
in the streets of a city: Persians with their tall
sheepskin caps, Turks with their fezes, and pagan Kalmucks;
it is perhaps as unusual a variety as the sight of Turks
and Persians in the streets of Venice.

The stranger’s first visit is to the Kremlin. Here he
stands on the navel of Russia. This is a holy place for
Russian patriotism. Here is the central point of the
empire; here the Tsar is crowned. Ascending the
highest tower, Iván Veliky, you can see an immense city on
every side, with gilded and green cupolas and roofs.
Here stood Napoleon with his marshals in 1812 and saw
the commencement of the conflagration of the city. Here
stood Madame de Staël and uttered the well-known words,
“Rome of the Tatars!” which depicts in a masterly
manner the impression made by the fountain-head of the
church of a barbaric race. But the old French proverb,
“Scratch a Russian and you will find a Tatar,” contains
a truth, though with so many limitations that it will be
wrong nine times in ten. The harsh rule of the
Mongolian for two hundred and sixty years (1220–1480) in fact
put Russia far back and had its baneful influence on the
Russian character; but it did not succeed in changing the
race, even if it made the blood less pure. The Russian
flesh and blood is concealed under many Tatarean
princely titles; under many customs originating with
the Mongolians, the Slavic temperament has held its own
incorrupted. That appeared when Peter the Great
undertook to scratch the Asiatic and found a European
under the foreign crust. Even if Kief is more entitled
to honor from the Russians than Moscow, on account of
its greater antiquity, and even if it is, like Jerusalem, the
holy city,—still, Moscow is always, for the inhabitants
of Greater Russia, the mother city, <i>Moskva mátushka</i>.

The vivid colors of these roofs, the bright gilding of
the cupolas of the churches, all this, which in a milder
climate would be in bad taste, has its foundation in the
climatic and historical relations, and most of all in the
length and kind of the winters. If you conceive a
winter where the snow for two hundred days together covers
everything, woods and fields, roads and streets and roofs
of the houses, with its monotonous sheet, you can
understand that some splendor is needed in the air to enliven
the world when the sun does shine for a day.

Winter is the characteristic season in Russia. Even
if the wind is cold, still it is not by far so strong as in
Denmark, so that a greater degree of cold can be endured
than here. Winter stamps the whole life and character
of the people.

The peasant is obliged to live immured in his hut,
with the walls and windows carefully closed to the cold.
He lives in bad air, by the light of a blazing pine knot,
close to the great stove, on the top of which the whole
family sleep at night. He sleeps with his clothes on,
including his sheepskin. He does not undress the whole
week through, except when, on Saturday, he takes his
Russian bath. But with his sheepskin he puts on his
vermin again.

With the higher classes the long winter has this
result, that night is turned into day. Social life in St.
Petersburg is even in a higher degree than in Warsaw a
night life. Even the most of the sleighing parties take
place in the night. In the silent quiet, the three horses
abreast with the light sleighs whistle over the snow and
ice fields. It is the combination of the silence of death
and the furious speed which amuses and satisfies the
Russian disposition.

In a southerly land like Italy vegetation is somewhat
uniform during the whole year. The laurels and the olive
trees are always green. In Russia, summer and winter
present two entirely different countries and aspects of
life. For a typical impression of winter the life in
Siberia in that season may be taken as described by
Korolenko, the poet of Little Russia, who returned from an
involuntary residence of several years in the department
of Yakutsk. He lived in a little house thatched with
deerskin. In such a dwelling, at the approach of winter,
blocks of ice are substituted for the windows, which
are replaced by panes of glass only when melted in the
spring. There is never a single day of thaw in winter.
It begins by barely freezing and gradually falling to fifty
to sixty degrees below zero. In order to breathe, they
wrap themselves up in a sort of boa or respirator of fur,
made of squirrel’s tails. The sun breaks through the
icy panes in strange and beautiful rainbow hues.

But the approach of spring awakes a new existence.
The fluid element, which had vanished, returns. The
real spring is detestable. But this disagreeable spring
thaw lasts only a short time, and is hardly considered in
Russia as one of the seasons. Still nothing can give the
Western-European a conception of the effect on the
mind and senses of this sudden plunge into summer.

It had been necessary to wear furs in Moscow; the
days were raw and the nights cold; it snowed and froze
until the streets, during the last of my stay (until the
middle of May), changed to a chaos of mud. Then one day
I was taken by an acquaintance to the Kursk Railway
station, and we journeyed for a day and night towards the
south. When we arose the next morning at five o’clock
summer was upon us. There was the country-house
surrounded with trees newly clad with foliage. There
was a fragrance from these poplars and birches as
intoxicatingly strong as the perfume of the plants in a
conservatory, and far more fresh. There was no grass, only
moss, but over the moss a never ending carpet of
extremely fragrant lilies of the valley. The dense, fresh,
primeval forest extended along the two rivers Diesna and
Bolva; and the nightingales sang in rich chorus, as I had
never before heard them. This was no accident, for this
is the country of nightingales above all others. It is
said that in the vicinity of Kursk and Orel
(pronounced Aryól) the nightingale is to be found in the
greatest numbers and sings the best of all places on the
earth.

To sum up the characteristics, this is a land where
everything is extravagant and nothing temperate. In
the next place, just as the conditions are extraordinary,
immense, so the uniformity is great, and as the natural
uniformity is great, so is the variety produced by the
seasons great. All is laid out on a large scale, cities and
provincial towns. There is room to spare everywhere,
as in the United States.

<sc>If</sc> the stranger has now looked about at all in this
land, he will necessarily be inclined to reflect on the
condition of the people who inhabit it, and will strive to
reach clear conclusions as to the fundamental elements
of their character.

The truth has been expressed in many different ways,
especially in earlier times, that the Russians have
invented very little, have contributed nothing, so to speak,
to the development of civilization, but have only
appropriated the culture of others. They are, it is said, a
people of imitation, a people without originality.

It cannot be denied that of all the larger European
nations this is the one which has borrowed the most of
foreign culture, and whose native culture strikes one
least. It shows itself in something external, as in this,
that, while a travelling Englishman may be detected at
the distance of a hundred paces, you must look well
to recognize a Russian on his travels. It is, moreover,
scarcely any extravagant exaggeration to say, as in the
first part of the “Main Currents,” that a square yard of
the Roman Forum has more history than the whole
Russian Empire.

And yet the observation is very superficial which
characterizes the Russian people with the word exotic.
The traveller in Russia who asks himself the question,
What is there here original? will not fail to find an
answer, when he directs his mind from the trivial and
unimportant to the most fundamental qualities which
he can trace.

He is, very likely, first struck by the way in which the
horses are harnessed to the carriages. In no other place
is this done as here; in no other country are three horses
used with one carriage in so stylish a manner. It is no
slight or common sense of beauty which prompted this.
In the next place, there is a very striking originality in all
kinds of manual labor. This is seen in the patterns of
embroidery (also well known here from the Russian
embroidered handkerchiefs), in the harmony of bright colors
which characterize all Russian ornamentation and
decoration, from the ancient manuscripts down to the
beautiful enamel in gold and silver of this present day, and,
finally, in the style of architecture, which, although it is
a composite of Byzantine and Mongolian, Hindoo and
Persian, Gothic and Renaissance, still has obtained a
marked national character as the embodiment of the
Russian-Greek Church.

In the next place, this people have an original
conception in their civil relations, the so-called <i>mir,</i> a
municipality whose bond of union is home rule and common
ownership of the soil.

Russia is primarily and in its very essence a
patriarchal state, a state where the father has the authority
and the children are in a condition of equality with one
another. As a result of a development ordained by fate,
Russia has become a bureaucratic state, where official
power has destroyed all spontaneous and natural growth
in the relations of public life. Nevertheless, the family,
the municipality, and the state in Russia are three
organisms, constructed on entirely homogeneous principles, but
moving in different spheres. The great Russian family
is not restricted to parents and children; it includes
several generations and many families. Married sons,
brothers of the father or of the mother, have down to a
very recent period constantly worked in the same house
or on the same farm, yielding obedience to the authority
of the eldest, and with property in common. This family
relation is now being broken up, because in it (as in the
state) the paternal authority has been inflated till it has
become unnatural and oppressive.

In the mean time, the municipality is only the larger
family, as the state is only the union of all the
municipalities into one great family, whose father is the Tsar.
The Russian family has two decided characteristics: the
unlimited authority of the father, and the undivided
possession by the children. The Russian state, absolute
monarchy, has developed the first; the Russian
municipality, <i>mir,</i> the second. In fact, these two characteristics—the 
power of the Tsar and the ownership of land in
common—are the two fundamental principles which
distinguish the Russian people from all others. It is very
true that many other countries, Denmark among the
rest, have long known a similar common ownership of
property; but elsewhere it has been abolished with the
abolition of serfdom, or with the emancipation from
villanage; here, on the contrary, it still survives. While
the common family (or the organization which may be
termed a family partnership) is undergoing dissolution
since the emancipation of the serfs, the municipal joint
property has not only held its own since then, but it has
even increased at the expense of private property. In
the department of Moscow, since 1861, of 74,480 farms
only nineteen have abandoned the joint proprietorship;
and at the present time, in the whole of Greater Russia,
of all the peasant farm lands 90-98 per cent are owned
in common. Even in White and Little Russia common
ownership has made inroads.

It is natural that the Russians, underneath the
socialistic agitations of our time, should see in their <i>mir</i> the
healthy germ of better social relations. They generally
regard themselves in this particular as the pioneer or
prototype for Europe.

Intellectual originality among the Russians is,
naturally, much less easily grasped, but it is not on that
account the less indisputable. Intellectually, the
Russians impress the stranger by their realism, their practical,
positive taste for the real, which has made them a great
people and has won so many victories in the battle of
life. It seems to be this quality which has given the
inhabitant of Great Russia superiority over all the other
races of the empire. While the Little-Russian possibly
surpasses the Great-Russian in continued action, through
his vivacity and delicacy, his sensibility and disposition,
he lacks the sound common sense of the other. This taste
for realism has shown itself to be the strong point of the
Great-Russian. It is this among other things which
explains how it is that, where a realistic tendency in
modern times has prevailed in French literature, and
books of this intellectual character have been brought to
Russia, they have been received there as the representatives 
of something old and well known. A long time
before, the Russian authors had solved the problem of
the novel in a like manner. At the time when France
was becoming the most infatuated with Romanticism,
the whole Russian novel literature had already begun to
produce the description of actual life, and Art had begun
to follow on the track of Poetry.

The result of this realism is that the Great-Russian
despises the Little-Russian as sentimental and effeminate,
and looks down upon the Pole as on a being weak and
unreliable, or, on a higher plane, romantic and fantastic.
There is also the strongly developed realistic tendency
which has deprived the Russian of all metaphysical
qualities, and led him, as a rule, to take interest in only
two groups of sciences—the physical and social.

The form of government in Russia is not now of the
kind to give free scope for any sort of originality. And
while independent thought in political affairs is not
allowed any outlet, and is almost equally debarred from
full and free expression in literature on account of the
censor, there is no obstacle to singularity, individual
peculiarity, and absurdity, which not infrequently becomes
merged into mysticism, a Slavic peculiarity, but one which
with the Russians is wonderfully united to realism.
Gogol comes to us a representative of the past, and
Tolstoï of the present time. It is this mysticism which
is outwardly shown in the numerous sects which are
found in Russia. The membership of the sects amounts
to fourteen or fifteen millions, divided among some fifty
or sixty different moral and religious systems.

The trait, however, which struck me personally more
strongly than any other, and one which I met with in the
most developed and also, so far as I could judge, the most
typical individuals, was what they themselves called <i>une
large franchise,</i> a broad and proud frankness.
Nowhere else are men and women occupying the most
advanced places in culture heard expressing themselves
so openly and without reserve. They not only give
utterance to their ideas and thoughts without hesitation,
but they not infrequently expose traits of their own
lives, traits which they must see may be judged
differently, without any fear of losing anything in the opinion
of others. Behind this transparency, which especially
surprises us in the women, there lies: “Such am I; I
appear as I am—too broadly and largely constituted to
be reserved and prudent, and too sure of my position in
life not to be dependent on my own judgment.” The
meaning of this in social intercourse is: “This is what I
am. Tell me what you are. What is the profit of this
reserve! Life is short, time is scantily measured out; if
we are to get anything out of our intercourse, we must
explain what we are to each other.” And behind this
frankness lies the emotion which works most strangely
of all on one who comes from the north, a horror and
hatred of hypocrisy, and a pride which shows itself in
carelessness—so unlike English stiffness, French
prudence, German class pride, Danish nonsense.

The basis of this is the broadly constituted nature,
without frivolity, without narrowness, without bitterness—the 
true basis of originality in Russia.

And this, which is thus opened to inspection when this
natural disposition is examined, this is a peculiarity which
is unique among the national peculiarities of Europe.

The fundamental inclination, which numerous experiences 
disclose to the stranger, is: the inclination to have
their swing. It is not simply the inclination to extremes.
But it is this: when a Russian has got hold of a thought,
a fundamental idea, a principle, a purpose, without
regard to its origin, whether it originated with himself
or was borrowed from European culture, he does not rest
until he has followed it out to the last results.
Therefore the Russians are the most arbitrary oppressors in
the world and the most reckless liberators, blindly
orthodox, following sectarian religions to self-destruction,
free-thinking to Nihilism, sedition to attempts at murder
and dynamite assaults. If they believe in the idea of
authority, they bow down till the forehead touches the
earth before it (<i>chelobitie</i>); if they hate the idea of
authority, that hate forces percussion bombs into their
hands. They are radicals in everything, in faith and
infidelity, in love and hate, in submission and rebellion.

Finally, there is one more fundamental trait of the
Russians, one which seems most vigorously to combat
the idea of originality: the inclination to imitation, the
power of echoing, of reflecting after the Russian spirit,
the capacity to accommodate themselves to the strange
and to adapt the strange to themselves. It is first and
foremost a capacity to understand and then a disposition
to appropriate.

It has been claimed that the Germans possess a
similar quality of seizing upon everything foreign, and by
translation or penetrating comprehension making it their
own. They have this quality in the highest degree.
But it is of a different kind with them. Herder’s highly
endowed, but ponderous and slow people understand
ponderously and slowly national intellects: they grasped
Greece, Calderon, and Shakespeare before any of the other
European nations; but they are not able, on that account,
to become so thoroughly imbued with the genius of the
foreign race as to reproduce it and act in its spirit. The
French, who did not appreciate the Greeks, came far
nearer to them in their works than the Germans, who
did comprehend them. The Russians, above all others,
have the talent of grasping the manner of thought and
range of ideas of other races, of imitating them and of
dealing with them as their own intellectual property.
The cultivated Russian understands and always has
understood the living, the new, the newest in foreign
countries, and does not wait till it becomes cheap because
it is old, or has gained currency by the approbation of
the stranger’s countrymen. The Russian catches the
new thought on the wing. Their culture makes a
modern race, with the keenest scent for everything modern.
It has been often the case in our own time that authors
who have met with obstacles or aversion in their own
country have found their first sanctuary in the Russian
newspapers or from the Russian public. Who knows if
in this respect Russia will not in the future play a rôle
similar to that of Holland during the Renaissance, when
it furnished a place of refuge to those authors who were
persecuted at home? An omen of this is the hero-worship 
which exists in full bloom in Russia after having
been almost wholly lost in the rest of Europe.

This remarkable capacity for assimilation is also met
with, in matters of artistic handicraft, among the
peasants. The peasant readily takes to any kind of work.
He can imitate anything he sees. He knows ten trades.
If a traveller somewhere in the country loses a cap with
a peculiar kind of embroidery, ten years later the whole
region is reproducing it. Another traveller forgets in a
corner a piece of chased copper or enamelled silver,
and this waif gives rise to a new industry. Some of the
most celebrated producers of industrial art are self-made
men from the peasant class, men who have groped their
way to the position they now occupy. Maslianikof,
who as master potter has reached the post of
superintendent of the imperial porcelain-factory, was formerly a
peasant, and he has worked his way up, without any
training in the works, by his own individual exertions
and conjectures; and Ovtchinnikof, the celebrated
goldsmith of Moscow, whose transparent enamel was so much
admired at the exhibition in Copenhagen, was also born
a peasant, and is indebted to nothing but his natural
talents. He has succeeded, among other things, in
reproducing the old Byzantine art of using cloisonné-enamel 
to represent the human countenance, and in
getting on the track of one of the secrets of the Japanese
in the use of a fine red enamel with inlaid foliage of
silver, where the shadows of the leaves are brought out
by a device in the process of firing.

In this popular intelligence, exactly the opposite of
the English, the capacity for fructification, intellectual
suppleness, is the predominating talent.

It can easily be understood how a national character
of this kind should be developed in this land above
all others. We see before us an enormously large but
scantily populated country, very backward in education,
and which it is necessary at once to reclaim by new
settlements and to elevate by European culture,—a land
with broad, unoccupied territory, as in the United States,
and at the same time governed in much the same manner
as Turkey.

It is a great winter-land, and the first effect of the cold
is to produce inertia. That is possibly the cause of the
national inclination to indolence, which has obtained its
typical expression in Goncharóf’s novel “Oblómof,”
famous both in and out of Russia, and a monumental
picture of Russian sluggishness. Oblómof is a character
so slack, so tired, so indolent, so disinclined to activity,
that he loses his dignity, his self-respect, his sweetheart
and his fortune, from pure, insurmountable indifference.

The want of sufficiently nutritious food makes the
blood thin, the requirements for protection against the
cold make the temperament nervous. Passivity becomes
a fundamental trait, which is sharply and clearly
manifested in the popular amusements. While the Spaniard
takes his pleasures in bull-fights, either as participant or
spectator; while the Englishman boxes and rows, the
Frenchman fights, the Pole dances,—the Russian finds no
happiness in any kind of sport. His delight is to hear
a hand-organ or harmonica play, to swing and to ride on
the gravitating railway of which he is the inventor.

In every Russian <i>traktir,</i> where the common or better
class of people assemble to enjoy the national food and
to drink tea, there is found a great automatic organ,
sometimes reaching to the ceiling; and the coming guest
orders the waltz to suit his taste, never tired of hearing
a favorite melody. The swing, with its rocking ease, is
an indispensable accompaniment of every Russian festivity. 
But the gravitating railway, with its passive voyage
into the unknown, is the most characteristic amusement
for the Russian temperament. Without any exertion,
without moving a limb, the participant has the complete
sensation of having his full swing.

Passivity shows itself, in public and private life, in
the submission to the powers that be. But, at the same
time, sluggishness has its strength in passive resistance.
Absolutism not only cows, but it hardens. This stolidity
becomes the popular ideal. It is not the one who takes
the lead,—the daring, the defiant,—who is admired;
but the one who, without complaint, knows how to
endure, to suffer, and to die. This characteristic may be
seen more at large in Dostoyevski’s “Recollections of
a Dead House in Siberia,” in which, according to the
popular view, he who endures the lash and the knout
without asking for mercy is the object of veneration,—such 
as, among other nations, is bestowed on the hero or
conqueror for dealing blows.

This explains the fact that, although the Russians are
a brave people, and a remarkably steadfast people in
war, they are the most peaceful and unwarlike nation in
the world. The Russian officers have little class feeling.
They never, like the Prussians, form a military caste,
distinct from the people. They have no <i>morgue,</i> no
cruel haughtiness. While the German officer, even when
his education is the best, feels himself to be a sort of
priest,—a military <i>sacerdos,</i>—the Russian officer, even
when he is rude, is, according to his own conception, a
mortal like others.

In the next place, it seems as if the hard contest with
the harsh climate, which at the same time has made the
people hardy and inactive, has given them the apparently
contradictory qualities,—good nature and gruffness.

The popular temper seems to be at once unfeeling and
kindly. There is a Russian indifference to their own
sufferings, and a Russian sympathy for the sufferings
of others, to which this indifference contributes.

The Russian peasant often shows himself indifferent
to death. He generally has no special fear of death, and
he is indifferent as to inflicting death on others,
especially if it is a question of children or old people.
Horrible murders are thus sometimes perpetrated among the
peasants, without passion or malice. Compare, for
example, the child-murder in Tolstoï’s instructive drama,
“The Power of Darkness.”

Still more striking is the trait, which is here stated
from a verbal account, given by a Russian general.

The following incident took place in the time of the
Crimean War: A severely wounded soldier was dragging
himself along with difficulty, and in great pain, after his
battalion. His wound was so severe that there seemed
to be no hope of his recovery. His comrades then said
to him, with the deepest sympathy: “You are suffering
too much, you will soon die. Do you want us to end
your pain? Shall we bury you?”—“I wish you
would,” answered the unhappy soldier. So they set to
work and dug a grave. He laid himself down in it, and
the others buried him alive—out of pity.

When the general, who did not hear of it till it was
all over, afterwards said to the soldiers: “He must
have suffered terribly,” they answered: “Oh, no!
(<i>Nitchevo!</i>) we stamped the earth down hard with our
feet.”

This mingling of gentleness and ferocity is remarkable.
It is typical of the Russian common people. What is
otherwise inexplicable becomes clear when we see the
utter darkness of the ignorance in which the soul of the
poor Russian peasant vegetates.

In all probability, also, the strife with the natural
conditions has developed the practical qualities with the
Great-Russian,—the taste for that which is available
and useful in handiwork. In this aspect, it is suggestive 
that the most celebrated and most typical Russian,
Peter the Great, when he wanted to reform his country,
felt himself drawn to the mechanical inventions above
everything else. Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, in his
characteristics of that monarch, has pertinently made prominent
that, on his journeys, he did not visit the universities, but
the workshops and the dock-yards; that he brought back
to Russia anatomy, surgery, the art of the apothecary,
mechanics, ship-building, engineering, as well as a whole
army of workmen and master mechanics,—but that there
were no learned men or thinkers in his train. With his
own hands he essayed the whole range of manual labor:
entered the army as a drummer, served in the navy as a
pilot, knew how to build boats, forge iron, and engrave.
In the armory in the palace of the Kremlin, in Moscow,
there is shown a horseshoe which he hammered out on
the anvil, and a bowl which he modelled. The genial
muzhik shines out through this ruler as through so
many a gifted Russian nobleman.

As the severity of the climate is the cause of certain
national qualities, already spoken of, so it seems to be
the connecting link between the extraordinary uniformity
of nature and the melancholy which is so characteristic of
the Russian disposition. The Russian is melancholy,—yet 
not splenetic in solitude, like the Englishman. It is
a melancholy pervading the community. It is this which
easily glides into sectarian mysticism.

The union of the natural and historical conditions has
produced the Russian <i>mir</i>. Call to mind one or another
small country town, settled by Russian immigrants, in
the vicinity of one of the remote cities in the north, on
the Volga, only a century or two ago. Before it extend
the boundless steppes, from which hordes of wild
Tatars, the so-called Nogaï, are constantly threatening;
the forests round about are full of wild beasts and of
subjugated Tatar tribes, the so-called Cheremissians,
who are constantly rising in rebellion. An impassable
swamp separates the country town from the castle of the
Tsar, which in time of danger is the only place of refuge
of the inhabitants. In winter, the swamp is frozen over;
the cold reaches the neighborhood of —60° Fahr., and
the blasts from Siberia pile up mountains of snow,
which almost bury the whole town. Is it not evident
that in such circumstances there is no use for the saying,
“My house is my castle”? Such an idea would be
madness. Here, it is not only unsuited to the
surroundings, but impossible, to live alone, each family and
each farm by itself. Each one daily needs the help of
his neighbors for protection against the Tatars, for
defence against the wild beasts, for the clearing of the
woodland, and for breaking up the soil. The first and
most important thing is to take care not to starve to
death, and to preserve their own lives and the lives of
those dearest to them. Bread can nowhere be bought,
and to keep the road open to the castle requires the
united aid of all.<footnote>Tikhomirof: <i>La Russie politique et sociale,</i> p. 100.</footnote>

When every country town was composed, as a rule, of
only a few farms, it was of the greatest importance to
have as strong a league as possible between these towns.
And thus it came about that all the thoughts of the
peasant were concentrated on giving to this league,—the 
<i>mir,</i>—his world, his true fatherland, as perfect an
internal structure as possible. Necessity taught him
to unite with his equals, and to manage his own affairs
in union with them.

Russia, as is well known, has been a constantly
growing empire since the time of Peter the Great. Since
then, it has annexed annually, on an average, a territory
as large as Denmark. While its western boundaries in
our time cannot be extended or are even insecure,—for
in a great war neither the Baltic provinces nor Poland
could be depended on,—its Asiatic boundary is elastic,
and is constantly moving towards the east and south.
The significant condition of things is here manifested,
that such an immense empire is continually growing
larger, and, impossible as it may seem, all the new races
are immediately assimilated: the Russian race still
maintains its supremacy and moves on everywhere, however
far the boundaries are extended.

It seems as if the natural conditions of empire had
been a controlling force in this direction. The broad
endless plains have from an early time awakened a
migratory passion among the peasants. They never
emigrate to North America, like the peasants of other
countries; they go to new places in the Russian Empire.
The Russian peasant has always been given to roving.
He has been accustomed to make a day’s journey to
fairs, and to pass weeks and months in a pilgrimage to
Kief; nay, even to this day the Russian peasants in
crowds make pilgrimages to Jerusalem. For this reason
they are exceedingly well fitted for colonizing a new
country. Although they are bound to Russia, they do
not feel at all bound to their homesteads. Nature is, so
to speak, uniform, wherever they go. They can wander
for weeks together over the steppes without seeing any
special change. They can build new houses (<i>izbás</i>) for
themselves in a few days anywhere. For, from a fear
of fire, which in Russia, on account of the droughts and
the construction of the houses, is more frequent than in
other countries, the peasant never ornaments his <i>izbá</i>.
The new house contains everything which was contained
in the old. He misses nothing in it. The new soil
which he is cultivating brings forth just as good a
harvest as the old. And by his emigration he has satisfied
his desire for adventure, for new experiences, and for
seeing new faces.

There is this peculiarity about the steppes, that they
continually invite one to go on and on. Level as the
sea never is, it evokes limitless reveries, passion for
wandering about, thirst for novelty, and the inclination
to let every idea be pursued to its never-reached end.

The uniformity of the country gives to the Russian
the roaming propensity, the contrasts of the climate
make a certain pliability necessary in the face of the
great and sudden changes, which may be the basis of
the Russian flexibility in intellectual matters, and is
perhaps connected with the spasmodic in Russian
manners and mode of life.

It is the suppleness in the Russian’s nature which
makes him so susceptible to foreign impressions. The
intellectual transition to the Russian talent for 
imitation, and the ability to appropriate everything which is
foreign, flows from this flexibility. Looking at it in this
connection (that is, from the standpoint of its cause)
this quality of comprehension and assimilation, it seems
to me, has its character of originality. Looking at it
abstractly, the lack of originality becomes the
foundation of a new originality in the culture of Europe.

It is quite certain that this Russia has always been
the pupil of the whole world. It is quite certain that
this Russian people is indebted to each and all the
nations of Europe. The foundations of its empire were
laid by Scandinavian chiefs; almost all the names of the
Varings are Norse, and so are the “Russian” names of
the Dnieper Falls preserved by Constantine Porphyrogenetes; 
even the name <i>Rus</i> is in all probability a Norse word,
even if other explanations are not absolutely excluded.<footnote>See William Thomsen: “The Relations between Ancient Russia
and Scandinavia, and the Origin of the Russian State.” Compare
Elisée Réclus, cited before, tome v. 301.</footnote>
Modern Russian civilization exhibits strong proofs of the
Byzantine and Tatar influences. The Russians as a
nation have been to school to the Poles, then to the
Germans and Dutch, and then to the French. Finally, they
have received impulses from the whole of West-Europe,
and their <i>belles-lettres</i> have been influenced by the whole
of civilized Europe. All this cannot be denied, and it is
equally true that when we stand in St. Petersburg and
look at this Winter Palace, built from designs by the
Italian Rastrelli, and the beautiful equestrian statue,
the work of the Frenchman Falconet, or when, in
Moscow, you gaze upon the walls and towers of the Kremlin,
built by Lombardian and Venetian architects, or when,
finally, in front even of Vasíli Blazhémnoï, the model
of all time-honored Byzantine Muscovite churches, we
learn that it also, with its domes, which are like bulbs
and pine-apples, dentated and peeled fruits and buds, with
its towers in all forms and hues, was built by Italian
artists of the Renaissance,—then we unquestionably
wonder what the Russians themselves have done. But
it will also be noted that the Russians have compelled
the foreigner to work in their spirit or adopt and develop
the peculiar Russian style.

At the present time, the unlimited capacity of receiving 
that which is foreign means scarcely anything else
than the intensified ability to fructify. It is this which,
among other things, becomes ardor, enthusiasm,
deification of genius, hero-worship.

All springs from the <i>broadly constituted nature
(shirókaya natura)</i>. The Russians have an expression,
<i>Chernozióm</i>—the black earth, mould. They mean by it the
broad and deep belt of fertile soil, <i>humus,</i> which extends
from Podolia to Kazán and even across Urál into
Siberia. The wonderful fertility of this soil is ascribed to
the slow decay of the grass of the steppes, which has
been going on for centuries.

The richest and broadest Russian natures remind us
of this belt of rich soil. Even the circumstance that the
Russian nature has been lying fallow for hundreds of
years increases its wealth.

You occasionally meet a man or woman who exactly
embodies this Russian soil — a nature which is open,
rich, luxurious, receptive, warm without glow or heat,
but which gives the impression of inexhaustible
exuberance.

A foreigner who had delivered a course of lectures in
the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow, where the university 
for women founded by Professor Guerrier and his
colleague was situated until it was recently closed,
related the following little trait of Muscovite enthusiasm:
“At the time when the university for women was in
existence, I went, one forenoon, into the hall where I had
lectured the evening before. I was going to have some
changes made in the arrangement of the chairs. I was
sitting alone in the hall, and waiting, when a door was
half opened and a young girl looked in and withdrew
smiling. A few moments later a hundred young girls
came quickly in through the door, all in black woollen
dresses, formed a circle around me, and began to clap
their hands. Then one of them, the daughter of a
celebrated deceased poet, said a few words to me, and they
clapped again. I believe it is the pleasantest impression
of my journey.”

Every one who knows how to see will discover similar
little traits of surprising warmth and simplicity, during a
trip in Russia. It is, possibly, this receptiveness, this
prodigality of nature, this inexhaustible richness of the
material life, which makes the greatest attraction of
Russia, and which betokens its future more decided
originality.

Black land, fertile land, new land, grain-land, — that
is its constitution. The broadly constituted, open, rich,
warm nature,—that is Russia’s. And when you are
turning over these qualities: the unlimited extended, that
which fills the mind with melancholy and hope, the
impenetrable, darkly mysterious, the womb of new realities
and new mysticism, all these which are Russia’s,—then
it strikes one that they suit the future almost as well,
and the question presses itself upon us whether, when
we are striving to penetrate the secrets of this land, we
are not gazing into the very future of Europe.

As may be imagined, the foreigner has little chance to
see the real Russian people in motion in the open air.
All public life, meetings, conferences, unions, are
forbidden — nay, impossible.

Still the traveller who is in Russia at the right season
can get a distinct impression of the character of the masses.

In St. Petersburg, Easter is the gayest season for the
common people. In the largest open place, the Field of
Mars, where the soldiers are drilled at Easter, four or
five large theatres of unpainted wood are erected, side
by side, and in these theatres plays are acted, with short
intervals between, from morning till night. In the
vicinity of the buildings there was a large, permanent market,
and, especially on holidays, a great crush of spectators
and purchasers. The whole goes under the name <i>balagani</i>.

The principal amusement of the poorer people, who
have not the means of paying the cheap admission fee to
the theatres, is this: On the open balcony which
encircles the theatre walks from side to side a youth, dressed
like an old man, with an enormous wig of long white
hair and a long white beard, — who, sitting down, with
his legs hanging from the scaffolding, collects a crowd.
He is called <i>Stárik</i> (the old man). What he says is the
most childish and harmless nonsense, — “If I had plenty
of money I would eat this and that for breakfast, so and
so much for dinner,” etc. [absurd quantities], — and they
laugh. Or, “You, down there, don’t forget to take off
your boots when you go to bed at night,” — and more
nonsense of equal value. He speaks just as we do to
children of six or seven years, when we want to make
them laugh.

We go inside and see a real play. At the best theatre,
<i>Suvórof</i> is given, a national play in three acts. It is now
two o’clock in the afternoon, and the piece has already
been played four times since nine o’clock in the
morning. It takes about an hour. The auditorium is as
simple as possible — a shed; the seats are unplaned,
wooden benches, like those used at the Passion play in
the Tyrol. The audience is made up of very simple
people: servants, peasant men and women from the
vicinity; petty tradesmen and their wives, from the
suburbs. They wait in silence, Russian silence, till
the curtain rises.

Suvórof is the popular national hero of Russia. A
short distance from the theatre stands a bad academical
statue of him, in ancient Roman costume, with bare legs,
which resembles almost anything, only not at all,
externally, a careless Russian general. Thus the actor, hoarse
as he is, has more of the real Suvórof than the statue.
This great man was, in reality, a genuine Russian
eccentricity, undoubtedly the only genius among the generals
of Russia. While Kutúzof, the loiterer, whom Tolstoï,
from philosophic-religious reasons, has glorified and
idealized in “War and Peace,” was a nullity, who
appropriated Barclay de Tolly’s plan of the campaign, and for
whom circumstances conquered, Suvórof was a real
military genius, irresistible even at the head of only a mere
handful of men. His crossing the Alps from Italy to
Switzerland was undertaken under greater difficulties
than either that of Hannibal or of Bonaparte.

Very significantly he is represented in the play
exclusively from national patriarchal aspects. He is
glorified in the Russian spirit on account of his fatherly
disposition, and not for his courage or his victories.
And — suggestive enough in regard to the Russian taste
— in this piece about a war hero there is no burning
of powder, no shooting. No, the common man here sees
with surprise and pride Suvórof clad in an old,
worn-out uniform, like a common soldier, even carrying his
baggage in a bag on his back, — living with the soldier,
and eating as he does the same food, a father to all.

There is a well known anecdote of Suvórof, that when
he awoke in the morning — and he was generally the
first — he used to crow like a cock to awaken his
associates. As <i>General Cock-a-doodle-do</i> he has been
famous throughout the whole of Russia. In the play this
characteristic is abused to such a degree that the hero
shouts his Cock-a-doodle-do thirty times, or speaks of its
use on earlier occasions. And the screech is every time
followed by the exultation of the audience. So also
are the scenes in which he declares to the common
soldier that he is as good as a general when he does his
duty, and offers him his hand, — a scene where he sends
away the decorated bearer of a flag of truce, who is
astonished at the sight of his simple barracks, — scenes
where he comforts and assists his subordinates, jokes
with them, and exacts the same things from himself as
from them. When a play like this is compared with
the national plays of other countries, about the military
heroes of general reputation, it strikes one that
invariably, in the latter, dash is the quality which is
illuminated with Bengal lights, while in the former it is
patriarchal simplicity, the paternal relation of the leader of
the army to the soldier, that is emphasized.

The same patriarchal trait appeared in another sight
of the Easter festival, in the open streets. Young girls
of the upper classes of the Imperial Girls’ School were
driven in a long procession through the streets in the
imperial carriages. The pleasure for them was only
that of being allowed to take a drive in a stylish court
carriage, with coachman and footman in the imperial
livery; for there was nothing special to be seen.

The theory of this is that the Tsar stands in a sort of
higher paternal relation to all these children. When he
once a year visits one of these schools,—to which only
the children of the nobility are admitted,—it is a
custom that, as a sign of his favor, he drops his
pocket-handkerchief, and the girls all scramble for it, and it is
torn in pieces, so that each one can get a fragment. He
takes the most brilliant girl to the table, and tastes of
the food of the institution. It is valued as the highest
distinction when he gives one of the girls his plate with
what is left upon it. It is the custom and usage for her
to swallow it with delight shown in all her features.
Great was the stupefaction of Alexander the Second
when a young girl, a Pole,—from whose own mouth I
had the story,—whom the Tsar had taken to the table,
as the most distinguished scholar of the institute, and to
whom he shoved what was left of roast meat and
potatoes,—nodded to a servant, and calmly gave him the
Tsar’s plate to take away.

The Tsar has always stood in the position of their
common father to the people of the lower ranks, although
the foundations of this feeling have of late been
somewhat shaken. At the same time, as the present
government in Russia has placed itself upon a war footing
towards the advanced classes of the people by the very
act of putting the greatest impediments in the way of
the passion for learning and travel, so it has foolishly
decided to forbid the holding the celebration of the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the abolition of serfdom.
The now emancipated serfs consequently think it proper
to infer that those who are in the highest places repent
of what was done.

In the cities, the Russian common people are found in
the genuine Russian tea-houses, where they have the
melodies ground out for them in the organs, and enjoy
the pleasure of having music at tea. There also the
workman or the peasant is generally to be seen on his
Friday, or when he has got a little too much in his head,
with his harmonica in his hand, that instrument which
demands so little skill and has superseded the balalaïka
of earlier times. I shall never forget a slightly
intoxicated young workman in Smolensk, who was reeling
along happy in the middle of the street, working away
on his accordion while the inhabitants from all the street
doors accompanied his wanderings with looks and smiles.
Seeing him suggested the role the accordion plays in
Tolstoï’s “Power of Darkness.” We cannot help
comparing mentally the gay tramp of young men through
the streets of Rome, keeping step to the melody of the
guitar, or the artistic four-part songs of the Germans.
Here is delight in music which is elementary and only
half developed. Gentleness and naïvete in this popular
pleasure are united with rudeness and stupid melancholy.

In the vicinity of Moscow, on the first of May (Russian
style) there was an opportunity of seeing a celebrated
national festival, which annually takes place in
Sakolniki Park. It is a wood of tall spruces, traversed by
many broad carriage-roads. From the grand avenue
radiate seven principal roads, which are mutually united
by cross-roads. There are also smaller roads and paths,
which lead to numerous villas in the Russian Swiss
style.

Even the promenade on the first of May, which was
meant as a sort of Corso, and for which it was necessary
to engage your carriage days before if you would have
a suitable conveyance, by a genuine Russian arrangement
lost its whole Corso character. All of these numerous
roads, for the whole distance from the city, were guarded
by Cossacks and gensdarmes on horseback, who were
stationed by the side of the road, about twenty yards
apart, so that there should be no riot, and for the sake of
good order it was decided at the last moment that the
lines of carriages should not cross each other in the
park, notwithstanding the fact that there was room
enough. Thus, instead of being able to enjoy the usually
varied scenes of a Corso, there was nothing to be seen
except the back of the driver, the tails of the horses, —
and your lady’s face, if you were fortunate enough to
have one with you.

In the park, on the great lawns, the common people
were collected in great swarms. But neither song nor
music was to be heard, nor a single shout or noise of
any kind. The people amused themselves in perfect
silence. Here were gravitating railways, which afford
a pleasure very much like that of the toboggan slide at
night: the combination of silence and furious speed
which answers for the enthusiastic phase of the national
character, and to the Russian favorite word, which is the
peculiar characteristic device of the passionate Russian
woman,—<i>Avós,</i> “Fire away,” the French <i>vogue la galère</i>.
In the next place, the second, also characteristic popular
amusement, which corresponds with the lymphatic
temperament of the nation, was supplied to the common
people in constantly used swings of all kinds. At the
same time the humor with which we in Denmark amuse
ourselves in the parks on a spring clay, was wanting. The
lines between the different classes of society, also, are
nowhere with us, outside of the metropolis, so sharply
drawn as here.

While in cities like London, Paris, and Berlin the
museums and other places of education are constantly
filled by the common people, seeking instruction suited
to their capacity, and for whom, even when they possess
only the most moderate abilities, the use of such places
has been made easy, nothing whatever corresponding to
it is to be found in Russia. The Hermitage in St.
Petersburg, with its large and valuable collection of objects of
art, is commonly inaccessible and little visited. The
museums in Moscow are also rarely open, and have even
less of an instructive character. Not even the memorials
in the large cities have any educational qualities. They
glorify the Tsar and the generals or national heroes, and
are designed only to aid in the deification of the Tsar and
national self-esteem. In this respect they are behind
Berlin, where, since the establishment of the kingdom,
no small number of statues have been erected which
represent neither kings nor warriors. The re-action in
Russia even at the present moment is so great that even
the possession of a statuette of Falconet’s Peter the
Great is taken as a sign of disloyalty rather than the
opposite: Peter was a man of the West, a European.

Besides the emperors and generals in bronze, only one
single statue is to be found in St. Petersburg. It is a
very unpretending and modest memorial of the fabulist
Krylof, in the imperial summer park, the playground for
children. It is placed just as that of Hans Christian
Andersen is in the Rosenburg Park, only the Russian
statue is better, and the various reliefs on the base, which
represent the whole animal world crowded together, are
more amusing, though on the other hand, less artistic
than the Danish. In Moscow there is a large group of
the two liberators from the yoke of the Poles, the
butcher Minin and Prince Pozharsky, whose celebrity
dates from 1612, and to whom also a memorial is erected
in Novgorod. There is besides this a modern statue of
Pushkin, which is not remarkably good. Smolénsk is the
birthplace of the musical composer Glinka, and there is
found a statue of him, a square-built little man, not
particularly suitable for the plastic art. Nevertheless, they
had the original idea of putting slender cross-lines in the
iron railing which is around the memorial, to represent
the musical staff, and thus encircle the composer with
his best known melodies.

While other European states do something, even if not
all they might, for the instruction of the people, the
government here dislikes popular education, and puts
innumerable obstacles in the way, — nay, even does what it
can to oppose it. As has already been said, the cities do
not afford nearly as many opportunities for the
instruction and cultivation of the common people as the cities
of other countries. As in the country the fight against
knowledge can be carried on with much greater emphasis,
a still more appalling ignorance is the result, in spite of
the excellent natural capacities of the people.

It may be said without exaggeration that there is now,
as in the time of the Tsar Nicholas, a constant exertion
on the part of the rulers to make real knowledge
impossible and to destroy all individual and independent will.

Three kinds of books are published in Russia:—First,
the forbidden, that is, nearly all valuable literature,
except when with ineffable art and resignation it is
shaped so as exactly to suit the demands of the Russian
censor; second, the allowed innocent <i>belles-lettres</i> and
purely technical works, yet with this limitation that
in the German Conversations-lexicons of Myers and
Brockhaus all the articles about Russia and all the
biographies of Russians are blackened over on account of the
spirit in which they are written, though they necessarily
contain almost nothing but known facts. The anxiety
even extends to foreign lands. In a French book which
was sent to me from Russia last year, the censor had
cut out a leaf, on which, as the context showed, was
something not unfavorable, but not absolutely favorable,
to the deceased Tsaritsa. Third, the last category of
books consists of those recommended for use in
educational establishments and schools for the common
people. An idea can easily be formed as to what these are.

The solicitude lest the popular standard of knowledge
should be raised is so great that obstacles are put in the
way of elementary instruction of the youngest children. 
When, a few years since, a lady of high rank, of
whom nothing whatever of a revolutionary character
was known, the daughter of a well-known minister, who
under Alexander II. had carried through a legal reform,
a princess of great wealth, who could not possibly be
mistaken as having any wish to excite the peasants to
unlawful trespasses on foreign soil, wished to found an
orphan asylum in the country where she lived, she
sought permission for two years in vain and then
received a refusal. Leave must be asked in such cases,
and this kind of petition is not granted as a rule.

Thus it is no wonder that the condition of the
peasants in most respects makes an impression of profound
ignorance and of an Asiatic spirit of submission.

The lady of rank, on her estate, is greeted by every
peasant or workman, by every young or old woman of
the lower classes, who would ask assistance of any kind,
by falling flat on the face at her feet. Not only every
one who would beg, but every man or woman who would
ask a favor, falls on the knee before her and touches the
forehead to the dirt of the road. No remonstrances can
make them give up this custom. Significantly enough,
the striking of the forehead (to the earth) is even at the
present time the name of petitions to the Tsar
(<i>chelo-bitnaya</i>).

The superstition is as great as the ignorance.

In turbulent times it not infrequently assumes a
formidable character. When, in the time of the Tsar
Nicholas, the cholera broke out in St. Petersburg, the
common people ascribed such a mysterious origin to the
epidemic that they attacked in a frenzy some boys who
had been seen <i>pouring the cholera</i> into the Neva, and in
one of the market-squares they rose in a great revolt
against the police, because they had not arrested two
persons who had <i>brought cholera powder into a house</i>
to spread the contagion. It was on this occasion that
Nicholas, who was just driving past in his sleigh, and
witnessed the tumult, quelled it at once by raising his
arm in anger, and calling in a loud tone: <i>“On your knees.”</i>
This is the scene which is portrayed in relief on the base
of the memorial to him.

The superstition of the people still continues. In a
manufacturing region in middle Russia, where I was
staying, the lightning struck several times, or some other
misfortune happened, on Trinity Sunday. To avert the
wrath of Heaven, this year, the workmen asked the monks
in a cloister some miles away to lend them the miracle-working 
image of “the Blessed Virgin with three hands,”
which in that district is regarded as endowed with holy,
supernatural power, and this picture was brought to the
country town, with great pomp, in a special railway car,
accompanied by the singing of the priests and the
swinging of censors. The people collected at the station in
such numbers that those who were on the front part of
the platform were compelled to take refuge in the
railway carriage, to escape being crushed. The picture was
brought into the church, where a Te Deum was sung.
The day passed without either storm or accident, and
there was not a workman who had a doubt as to the
supernatural cause thereof.

Another illustration of the spiritual point of view of
the peasants and priests is the following from the same
time. Not far from the little town Biezhitsa the huge
head of a mammoth was found. A young princess, whose
country-seat was in the vicinity, bought this head of the
peasants. Some one or other who wanted to play a trick
on the public or the clergy wrote to the local newspaper
of the department that the peasants, after the head was
dug up, had brought a priest, who had read the prayers
for the dead over it and then buried it again. — Could
one believe it! On this account the whole clergy of
that region were excited, and just because what had been
stated in the article was untrue and nothing had
happened. What if it had been a human head, and they had
neglected to read the prayers for the dead! The
consistory in St. Petersburg sent a mandate to the most
distinguished prelate, required an examination into what
had happened, and commanded that the clergy of the
district should take the measure of the head that had
been found (literally — “inasmuch as it is of <i>anthropological</i> 
interest”). The day after a whole procession of
priests arrived at the country place and held a great
council as to how they ought to act to show that this
was a mammoth and not an <i>antediluvian man</i>, as they
expressed it, until the private tutor, a Panslavist
naturalist, who was able to inspire confidence, fortified by his
diploma, measured the head and gave the formal declaration 
that this head had never rested on the body of a
prehistoric Christian, but on a mammoth. The subject
is well fitted for a Russian farce, only it would never be
printed or acted.

The workmen in this district lived in barracks. One
hundred and fifty workmen slept in a narrow room.
Bunks were built up on the walls, so that they lay and
slept as in berths on board a ship, except that these
bunks or benches were so wide that the workmen lay
with their heads against the walls and their feet towards
the middle of the floor. There was no other furniture in
the room, nothing whatever, — no pillows, no carpet, no
chair, no table. The furnishing was exactly like a
dog-kennel. This unfortunate condition depends on the fact
that there are everywhere found contractors who keep
hundreds of workmen in the vicinity of the large
manufactories, to let them out as soon as there is need of them.
The food they get is a porridge which is scarcely cooked.
The rest is uneatable bread and undrinkable kvas with a
few pieces of cucumber in it.

A female physician gave the following account of a
visit to one of these barracks: A woman was expecting
her confinement in a little room where eight persons
were lying about her. When I was called, I was obliged
to shove them aside in order to deliver the woman. They
saw what was coming, shrugged their shoulders a little,
and went to sleep.	

The poorest workmen in this manufactory, where
mandrels are made, earn 17 cents a day, the more
skilful 27 cents, and the best workmen 43 cents.

This is the human material which the young men and
women, who strive to make the great populace share in
the advanced ideas of the age, must educate and rely
upon. It is plain that the education will take time, and
the aid they are now able to find is of no account.

Two short dialogues of Turgenief are given below,
which, on account of the censor, were omitted from the
“Poems in Prose,” — entitled “The workman and the
man with the white hands.”

In the first, the workmen wonder at the stranger, and
reject his claim of being one of them, while they point
to their own working hands, which smell of filth and tar,
and to his delicate white hands: “What do they smell
of?” — “Smell, yourselves.” — “It is strange ! We
should say they smell of iron.” — “Yes, of iron. For
six whole years I have worn handcuffs on them.” —
“Why?” — “Because I thought of your happiness. I
wanted to make you poor fellows free, I rebelled against
your oppressors; on that account I was put in prison.” —
“Prison!” — “Yes.” — “Why were you rebellious?”

In the second dialogue, which occurred two years
later, the same workman speaks to another about the
young gentleman who once talked with them: “He is to
be hanged to-day; the order has come.” — “Has he been
rebelling again?” — “Yes — again.” — “Well, Dmitri,
don't you believe we could get a piece of the rope he is
hanged by? They say it brings good luck to the
house.” — “Yes. Piotr, let us try.”

This, then, is the human material which the young men
and women who “go out among the people” try to
educate and elevate. They do it with an untiring, heroic
zeal, which is beyond all praise and without parallel in
any land. They leave relatives and friends, expose
themselves to cold and hunger, hatred and derision, scorn and
insult; they brave imprisonment, sickness and death,
with no other reward than that their own conscience
gives them. No honor of any kind awaits them; their
work is hidden, their offering is unrecognized. Their
outer life is a series of struggles and sufferings.

They constitute the outwardly active element of the
Russian <i>intelligentia</i>, — a world by itself, with its own
moral qualities, precarious at times, but always of
more value than the mercantile compound, which in
other parts of Europe goes under the name of moral, — a
pure young world, with the fiery faith of youth, and the
passive character of Russian heroism, constant even in
torture. The faith in their historic mission, and the
consciousness of their spiritual power, sustains them.

Tikhomirof, who has been one of the leading spirits
in revolutionary agitations, and who now lives an exile
in Paris, greatly deploring the attempts at assassination
which alone have made possible the re-action now
prevailing in Russia, is always fully trustworthy when he
portrays single traits, though not always when he
generalizes. He speaks of a young prisoner who was
constantly refractory and asking for unheard-of favors, such
as permission for the prisoners confined in cells to talk
and walk together. “It is necessary to protest,” he
continually repeated. — “But what can you accomplish?”
said his comrade. “You forget that you are under lock
and key. How are you going to find the power of
compelling the authorities?” — “The power! How? In
myself, in you.<sp> ...</sp> <i>I am myself the power!”</i> — “My dear
friend, that power the others can crush in a minute!” —
“Crush it! let us see first! let them try!”<footnote>Tikhomirof: <i>La Russie politique et sociale</i>, p. 280.</footnote>

Without doubt, in a classical sense the fundamental
trait of invincibility is the strength of the party of
agitation in Russia.



A conception of the stoicism of Russian prisoners can
be gained by reading, in Dostoyevski’s “Recollections
of a Dead House,” the number of lashes they endure
without a complaint or a groan. In later times, there
have been repeated instances of the resolution with
which political prisoners have sought death to avoid
disclosing their accomplices. One has killed himself by the
aid of petroleum, and another has cut his throat with a
fragment of glass, all access to weapons having been
denied them.

Out of Russia, an already extended list of revolutionary
spirits in this land has attracted the attention and kept
curiosity on the alert. We call them Nihilists,—of which
the Russian pronunciation is <i>neegilist</i>, which, however, is
now obsolete. Confined to the terroristic group in Europe
the number of these persons is certainly very small.
Perhaps, as is thought in Russia, there are five hundred
in all, who busy themselves, even if reluctantly, with
thoughts of resorting to bombs and murderous weapons
to inspire terror. But it is not exactly this group that is
meant when we speak of that nihilistic force in society
which extends everywhere, into all circles, and finds
support and strongholds at widely spread points. It is
indeed not very different from what elsewhere in Europe
is regarded as culture, advanced culture: the profound
scepticism in regard to our existing institutions in their
present form, what we call royal prerogative, church,
marriage, property.

The <i>nigilists</i> even do not call themselves by this old
name, to which currency was given by Turgenief, in
“Fathers and Sons.” It dates from the time when Russia 
by the death of the Tsar Nicholas had been liberated
from the system of compulsion intensified to the highest
degree under an absolute monarchy, and when not only
the liberation of the serfs was in the air, but thought,
which for a generation had been paralyzed, at once felt
itself free, unhampered, and unrestrained, and speech,
which so long had been the serf of the government, was
made free, or by a sort of inward necessity assumed
freedom. At that time, everything which had the ring of a
human voice was pure criticism, negation, revolt against
all ancient authority. With the wrath and enthusiasm
of youth, their inexperience ran away with them. The
young men showed their democratic proclivities by not
combing their long locks, not washing their hands, and
going about fantastically dressed; the young women
asserted their independence by wearing their hair short,
a plain dress, and using the blunt speech of the peasant.
Hatred of the old traditions of society, its hypocrisy and
its old customs, went so far that everything which had
hitherto been held sacred was despised on account of
the respect it enjoyed.

Yet this period was of short duration. Niekrásof (in the
“Cabinet of Reading”) makes a son answer his father’s
complaints in the following manner: “Nihilist is a
stupid word. But if you understand by it a man of liberal
ideas, who does not intend to live at the expense of others,
but works, seeks for the truth, is striving not to live a
useless life, looks every scoundrel straight in the eye,—nay, 
sometimes gives him a thrashing,—in that sense I 
do not see anything bad in it, and in that sense am I a
nihilist.”

At the present time, the discontented youth, in their
own language, call themselves <i>Nyelegalni</i>, — that is,
outlaws. To obtain a correct idea of them, you must, at
the outset, forget the old Bazárof (in “Fathers and
Sons”), who was at one time a true conception, but is
so no longer, as well as the young people in “Virgin
Soil,” who are foreign creations, and were never a true
representation, but particularly Dostoyevski’s “The
Possessed,” an ultra-reactionary caricature of a tendency in
which he participated in his youth, but to which by the
lapse of time he had taken an aversion. And it must be
remembered that no other sketches of this youth can be
found, in books which are published in Russia, than
such as are intended to pass the censor. And it would
be easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
than for a sympathetic sketch of the outlaw elements of
society to go through the Russian censorship.

A plainly clad, very intelligent young girl came to
a country town in the department of Orel, who
supported herself by the modest and unartistic employment
of painting portraits of the dead from photographs.
While very young, with some other young girls she had
gone among the people in the country to teach the
peasants to read and their wives to sew; she wished for once
and all to live with them. The authorities arrested these
young girls, separated them, and sent them all by the
administrative process to different remote towns,
despatching this one to a very small town in the department of
Vólogda. There she made the acquaintance of Viera
Sassúlitch, who was also exiled, and they lived there
together for several years. In this way she became
infected with revolutionary ideas. She was especially on
her guard with the families of rank and wealth in the
vicinity. But she met a lady to whom, after further
acquaintance had inspired her with confidence, she said:
“I see you are human; I class you as one of us.”

The most of these young girls are plain, rather
unattractive, hardly ever sensual. They are wholly entranced
by their ideas. Several ladies who were present as
spectators at the celebrated political trial which goes by
the name of the Trial of 193 report that all the women
who were implicated in it looked like pale nuns, thin,
very serious, care-worn; only one of them was at all
pretty.

The construction which obtains in the Russian
<i>intelligentia</i> of the freedom which can be found in the
intercourse between men and women is directly the opposite
of the French and Polish. Nowhere is the relation
between the two sexes judged with more liberality, and
in the cases where nature has broken over the boundaries
of law with greater toleration. No one in the more
cultivated circles of Russia finds it strange if a man and a
woman seek one another’s company by themselves. No
one on that account immediately believes that there is
any bond of love between them; least of all, are the sexes
regarded here (as in France) as on every opportunity
attracted to each other from brutish impulses. The
Russian mother is generally not afraid to leave her
daughter alone with a young man. Perhaps the indifference 
for <i>qu'en dira-t-on</i> is nowhere greater than in good
society here.

When Bourbaki’s army, in 1870, was forced to cross the
boundaries into Switzerland, and the soldiers were obliged,
after forced marches, to pass the night in the open streets,
in a pouring rain, no house, where there were only women,
would open its doors to them. Only two young Russian
women, who were studying in Switzerland, gave up to
some soldiers the only room they had, and passed the
whole night in their company rather than let them sleep
in the street, entirely unconcerned what stupid and
cruel popular judgment would be given to this step.
Also nothing is more common than the bond of
friendship between young students of both sexes, where
common interests, common ideals and plans for the future,
form that connecting link which in other countries is due
only to the attraction of love. Here the latter,
naturally, may be an element, but just as often it is wanting.
The intellectual curiosity and the youthful zeal for
reform are greater than elsewhere.

It must, however, be understood that these young
women would like to live a full human life. Anatole
Leroy-Beaulieu, who, plainly, has obtained the far larger part
of the material for his valuable book about Russia from
a small circle composed of those who were formerly
liberal but are now strongly conservative, has described
the nihilist women as living in a distinct kingdom of
disorganization, where “the free-love” principle has
introduced a “ manner of life customary among monkeys,”
and he speaks with a surprised recognition of the fact
that in these brutish circles there are, nevertheless, now
and then found vestals, who actually abstain from using
the freedom which they support in principle.

Tikhomirof (1886) cites against him that the free love,
only not interpreted as it is understood by the European
populace, has long ago been the recognized principle of
the whole Russian <i>intelligentia</i>—a principle which is
not even discussed any more, just as we no longer
discuss religious freedom or the freedom of the press. It
can be said that since Tchernuishevski wrote his
principal work, “What is to be done?” (1863),—nay,
substantially, since Alexander Herzen wrote his romance,
“Who is to blame?” (1847),—this problem is regarded
as substantially (so far as morals are concerned) solved.
Love is not understood in Russia, as in other countries,
as mere sensualism. And there is found within the
Russian <i>intelligentia</i> a true worship of love,—as of a
holy thing, lawful in itself.

The respect for the formal legal bond between man and
woman is comparatively weak; the view of the marriage
relation as a means of support is unpopular; sympathy
in the case where repentance at leisure has followed the
marriage in haste often has a humorous coloring here.
It not infrequently happens that, when, for one cause or
another, a greater incongruity of temper than usual has
been found to exist, the husband and wife give each
other complete liberty and continue their common life
as good friends. The young girl has here, perhaps even
more frequently than elsewhere, her ideal of life; she
does not wish to live a useless life. It would not be
possible for her to surrender herself coldly and brutally
like the very unreal nihilist in the play, by a Danish
author, “The Lodger” which is otherwise very admirable.
She would also be ashamed of entering into a matrimonial
contract simply for profit. But she would not be ashamed
of forming a connection with a man without the consent
of her parents, and without any legal formalities, if she
were seriously in love with him. She is more indifferent
to the judgment of the world than are the women of
other countries.

This mental and moral attitude has no connection with
frivolity or thoughtlessness. It is a fact shown by
statistics that two thousand women annually, of their own
accord, accompany the exiles to Siberia, frequently to
hard labor. In this way, a lady of high rank, Baroness
Rehbinder, some years ago went with the celebrated
physician Dr. Weimar, who was implicated in the trials
for the attempts at assassination.

It can generally be said of those who “go out among
the people” that, when the home life is oppressive or
obstructive, they seek emancipation from it at any cost.
It was in this view that what at the time was called <i>sham
marriage</i> was invented, though it has nearly gone out of
use. The young girl found a comrade of the same views
of life as herself, who consented to marry her <i>pro forma</i>,
but who neither had nor claimed any control over her,
and by whose aid she escaped from the surveillance of
her family. Sometimes it happens that the two (as in
Mrs. Gyllembourg’s “Light Nights”), after having
become better acquainted, actually marry; in other cases
the man is said to have abused the rights formally
conferred upon him and a separation is the result. Generally
the newly married couple have separated from each
other immediately after the wedding, each being free
and independent. As is well known in “Virgin Soil,”
Turgenief has described a kindred case, the relation
of brother and sister in the case of Nezhdanof and
Marianne, after he carried away the young girl.

However much these young women feel themselves
drawn towards the common people, it very seldom
happens that they fall in love or marry out of their own
rank; and, if it does happen, it usually brings its own
punishment. The following is an instance from my
own circle of acquaintance: A young girl loved a man of
her own, the higher classes. They were both exiled by
the administrative process, but were sent to the opposite
ends of Siberia and could never learn the least thing
about each other. In the country town where the young
girl was, after the lapse of a few years, she became
acquainted with a young workman exiled for the same
political reasons she was. She met him daily. He fell
passionately in love with her; they had a child. Other
exiles, on the way home, came to the town. Among
them was a young man of the same class in society as
the young girl, who knew something about her lover.
She was never wearied of asking him questions, and sat
and talked with him through the whole night. At 
daybreak, as she was sitting with the child at her breast,
the workman killed her in a fit of jealous frenzy. He
thought that in her face he read regret for having
stooped down to him. Two years after, the child was
brought to St. Petersburg, to her parents.

Very significant and instructive is an unprinted and
prohibited novel of Korolenko, the title of which is
“Strange,” and the plot as follows: —

A woman has been sent in exile to a distant province.
One of the gendarmes who has accompanied the young
lady is the narrator. She has not been able in advance
to find out where she is to be sent to, and is thus, by two
gendarmes, taken almost through the whole of Siberia.
One of the gendarmes, an uncultivated but fine fellow,
feels so deeply affected by her youth and charms that
he actually falls in love with her, and cannot obey his
orders. He tells her the name of the town which is
selected for her abode. “Good!” she says; “there are
several of <i>ours</i> there.” Immediately on her arrival, she
goes to a young man, whose name she knows, but whom
she has never seen, and takes lodgings in his house.
She falls ill, of a lung disease.

A month later the gendarme comes again through the
town, seeks her out, and finds the young man by her
bedside, and with astonishment hears them still using
the formal “you” to each other. It is impossible for
him to understand what kind of bond it is which unites
them; it is clear that it is not love; but the companionship 
of ideas is foreign to his scope of comprehension.
He makes known to the young girl his attachment for
her, but she drives him away with the greatest
abhorrence. She does not dislike him personally; but solely
because he is a gendarme, from principle, from love for
the cause to which she has devoted her life; he is for her
not a human being, only an instrument in the hand of
an evil power. The poor gendarme cannot possibly
understand this any more than what has been stated
above.

An author, who has a European reputation, gave me
the following account of his connection with this circle:
“About ten years ago, while I was living in Berlin, I
frequently received letters from discontented Russians,
of both sexes, some of them asking me to write for them
some pamphlets, which they could translate and distribute 
among the peasants; and others, in relation to a
monograph I had written about a celebrated revolutionary 
individual,—a book to which I am chiefly indebted
for my popularity in certain social circles in Russia. A
juvenile naïveté shone through the style of some of the
letters; but the tone of warm juvenile enthusiasm, united
to an energy of style,—which is uncommon even in men
of ability,—in one letter, where the Christian name of
the writer was only indicated by an initial, awakened
great surprise in me. As I remarked, in my answer, that
it was not new to me to find enthusiasm and energy
among the young men in Russia, I received, to my
amazement, the following reply: ‘It is very possible that you
have been accustomed to find these qualities among our
young men; but it does not apply to my case, for I have
for some years already been a grandmother.’ An
extended correspondence was the result of this letter.
But, after the lapse of some time, this, and other
correspondence of a similar nature, had to be suspended, on
account of the innumerable precautions my correspondents 
were obliged to take. As several of my books had
at that time just been forbidden in Russia, they did not
dare to write my name on the envelopes. They changed
the name, so that I was obliged to inform the 
letter-carriers of it. At the time of the attempts at
assassination, all correspondence of this kind was suspended.”

Not infrequently they are very young children who
embark upon the peculiarly Russian plans for the
improvement of the world. For, even if the old sometimes
possess a youthful enthusiasm, yet in Russia, as
elsewhere, it is the rule that years and experience bring
both men and women to regard the existing state of
things as stronger than it is, and the prospect of being
able to overthrow it, as much less promising than it
appeared to them in their youth. The observation has
also long since been made that, in the numerous political
trials of the last twenty years, hardly any one has been
convicted who was over thirty years old; even those
who were twenty-five years old were uncommon, the
ages of the majority varying from seventeen to
twenty-three.

In the spring of 1887, a young girl of sixteen was
arrested in St. Petersburg, whose parents were well
known everywhere in good society. Out of regard to
the high standing of her father, she was set at liberty;
but yet with such conditions that she now remains under
the surveillance of the police. A group of young
students had a weekly meeting in her mother’s house, — to
read Shakespeare aloud in Russian, as it was said. The
fact of these six or seven students meeting together so
regularly aroused suspicion; and the police sent a
warning, received an explanation, and answered: “It would
be better to abandon these readings.”

They apparently complied. Then the young students
were arrested. A manuscript translation of a little
socialistic tract, written by a man by the name of Thun,
was found in the rooms of one of them; and a card of
invitation was found, in the same handwriting, signed
with the young girl’s name. It was of no avail that she
denied all knowledge of the tract contained in the
manuscript.

She was very peculiar: homely, with beautiful eyes;
difficult to become acquainted with, for a little thing
would silence her. In the presence of a dashing woman
of the world or a beautiful coquette, she opened not her
mouth. She contended that it was impossible to say a
word in the presence of that kind of woman. She had
the whole severity of youth; forbearance was a virtue
she knew only by name. And she had youth’s naïve
faith in the efficacy of every kind of propaganda. Her
mother, a lady of thirty-five years of age, was
high-spirited and passionate, with all the luxurious vital powers
of the Russian blood. The whole emotional life of the
daughter had been absorbed by the intellectual; she
managed her mother as if the latter had been her own
grown-up child.

Still more rare than this type, there is among these
women the patient, light-hearted, on whom no
opposition makes any impression. A letter from a young
married woman, who had been exiled to a town in
Siberia, but without being confined in prison, was
somewhat to this effect: “Dear Friends,—I can imagine that
you are somewhat uneasy about me. But never in my
life have I been happier. It is quite pleasant to be
separated for a while from my beloved husband, who was
beginning to tire me. But that is truly one of the most
unimportant things. I have been received here not as
a criminal, but as a queen. The whole town is made up
of exiles, descendants of exiles, friends of exiles. They
actually vie with each other in showing me kindness—nay, 
homage. Every other evening, I am at a ball, and
never off the floor. This place is a true ball-paradise,” etc.

More frequent than this arrogance is a humility, a
profound, boundless modesty, which is genuinely Slavic.
In a small house with a garden, in a remote quarter of
Moscow, lived an extremely finely endowed young girl,
who for many years had been severely ill; and, as a
result, from time to time, especially when excited, lost the
power of speech. She lived a purely intellectual life,
wholly absorbed in intellectual pursuits; and, on account
of her poor health and weakness, was hardly a woman.
But a purer and stronger intellectual enthusiasm, and
more arduous exertions in that direction, are not often
seen. She translated a great deal from foreign
languages, and also wrote, herself. There was a combination
of energy and the most profound humility, which struck
the stranger who conversed with her. Her father had
been a well known professor of mathematics. She and
her two sisters, bright and healthy girls, supported
themselves respectably, orphans as they were, without
aid. The worship of the gifted invalid by the two
sisters, especially by the younger, was very touching.

One evening, in a company, a distinguished foreigner,
who had spent some time in St. Petersburg, described
another young girl of the same turn of mind and of the
same plane of culture, only seventeen years old, and of
far bolder temperament. “I have,” he continued, “met
her for a short time in society, but we were almost
immediately separated. I merely noticed that she had
beautiful, clear eyes, and cordial, but very decided
manners. The day before my departure, I received a long
letter from her, which seemed to me to be very interesting, 
because it gave me the impression of being
characteristic of a whole family. She wrote,—

“‘Permit me to express to you in writing what I had
not any opportunity to say otherwise. I do not speak
in my own name alone, but in behalf of a large part of
the young people of Russia, with whom you have not
had time to become adequately acquainted. I should
have said it to you, day before yesterday, at the D—s’;
but could not in the few moments we talked together.
You regretted having known, comparatively, so few of the
young people. That is partly because the time of your
visit was very unfortunately chosen, so far as the
Russian youth are concerned. It is just the time of
examination in all of the public institutions of education. But,
entirely apart from that, the Russian youth could not
make themselves known to you. Life deprives us of its
highest good,—freedom, and all the happiness which is
inseparable from it; but do not believe us insensible to
that which alone gives meaning and value to human life.
Quite the contrary. If fate has sent us so few blessings,
we love those we do receive all the more dearly, and
prize them the more highly. We prize above everything 
the science which emancipates. It is not allowed
to the Russian youth to express in writing what they
feel; but it would pain me, as a patriot, if you should
get an unjust impression of them. You once called
Rudin the typical representative of the Russian
weakness of character. “Weakness!” I exclaimed to myself
when I heard it. Oh, no! Do not forget that the
Russian literature is only an incomplete reflex of the life
and character of the Russian people. Do not forget
that they would make us deaf and dumb, and that we
are still too few in number not to be compelled to be so.
But we are really not like Rudin. Rudin is intelligent,
and has a certain quality of intellectual perception, but
has no depth of soul; he loves no one and no thing. He
is allured by the beauty of ideas; he is not drawn on
by true and earnest love for the human race. It is on
this account that he is a failure in his relation to
Nathalie, and especially in life, even if he does not succeed as
a hero. But, great God!—do not believe about us that
we are a failure in the wearisome battle of life, which
we are in, day in and day out. How unjust! my strong
and living faith is that Russia will some day come forth
cured of its political disease, and disclose itself liberally
and manfully. I believe not only in the Russian people,
but I believe in our intelligent youth, in their
receptiveness of everything which is true and therefore
beautiful. It betrays itself in the profound respect for
the men who understand how to find out and unveil the
meaning of things, and to open for us wider horizons.’”

There is, perhaps, nothing in this letter indicative of
uncommon abilities, and the seventeen-year-old child is
visible behind it; nevertheless, there is a personality in
it which may be typically Russian, and which it would
be impossible to find in a Scandinavian girl of that age,—and 
a will gleams out through the words, flashing like
a steel blade, a will which is full of promise.

One can form a vivid conception of this progressive
youth of both sexes, as they enter upon life, face to face
with the common people, whose elevation is the object of
their aspirations.

These young people represent the highest culture of
the age; among the peasants there is an ignorance which
renders it almost impossible to begin the communication
of information. An exiled mathematician, who had
returned from Siberia, a very practical young man, told me
that in the country town he was regarded as a man with
a supernatural insight, simply on account of his large
library; and after he had taught some peasants there, in
the spring, how to graft fruit-trees, they came to him
the next day from the whole neighborhood with sick
children and sick cattle, and besought him to undertake
a general cure: “Make them well, little father! make
them well!” When he assured them that he had not the
power to do it, there was not one of them who would
believe him. They begged, cried, asked him what they
had done to him that he would not help them: “You
know very well you can, if you will!”

In Benjamin Constant’s old work on “Religion,” it is
related that at the beginning of this century, when a
Russian general in full uniform rode out into a country
town in a part of Siberia but little frequented, he was
regarded by the natives as God himself, and that the
memory of his appearance got such a firm hold among
the people that when ten years later a Russian colonel
came to the same place he was greeted as the “Son of
God.”

That would hardly be possible now. Still, the following 
happened last year. A cultured Russian passed
through a town inhabited by Cossacks of Little Russia.
He was asked the question: “Will you be so good as
to tell us if you have been in the other world?” He
was offended, since he supposed that the inhabitants
meant to indicate to him that they did not believe what
he had said. But the fact was that one of the inhabitants
of the town had returned from a pilgrimage and had told
them that he came from the other world, and those
recently deceased in the town had requested him to bring
greetings to their relatives. He had gone away again,
loaded with rustic presents, to the departed relatives of
the credulous Cossacks. Now they wanted to find out
from the Russian gentleman whether these gifts had
reached their proper destination.

In the presence of such ignorance and naïveté mutual
understanding is difficult,—most difficult, perhaps, 
because the peasant does not like to be treated as children
are by their teachers. As a matter of course, he does
not like to have morals preached to him. When an
attempt was lately made on an estate to give a new
drama of Tolstoï, aimed against intoxicating liquors, and
in which the devil personally appears as the maker and
distributer of spirits, the peasants expressed their
disgust at it. It was, they said, a tale for children.

But the same peasants would readily believe that, if
the harvest was poor this year, it was because the priests
were now on a fixed salary. Heretofore the latter said
the mass earnestly, to get a good harvest and rich tithe:
this year it was all the same to them; therefore they
prayed negligently and without real heartiness. Drought
followed. And the same peasants explained the last
Russian-Turkish war by saying that in the country of the
Turks there lies in the ground a huge beast, of great age,
and under the claw of his left hind-leg an immense treasure 
of gold is buried, which the Tsar wanted to wrest
from the Turk.

It must not be forgotten that by the last returns
seventy-six out of one hundred of the soldiers could neither
read nor write.

On the other hand, let us examine the moral idea which
underlies the whole struggle of the intelligent people of
Russia: The wish to be useful, to see those about them
happy in freedom. This idea crops out in many different 
guises, now in the costume of the utilitarianism of
Bentham and Mill, now in the garb of Tchernuishevski’s
phalanstery, now in Dostoyevski’s strait-jacket, but it
is the basis of the philosophy of the enlightened
reformers of the fatherland and their friends of reform.

In speaking of the relations of the two sexes, attention 
has been called to the equality between the man
and woman, and to the greatest possible sum of human
freedom as the right of both. On this point we can
compare the manner of thought and action prevailing among
the peasants. External considerations are almost wholly
excluded from the marriage question in this class.
Nowhere else in Europe does the heart play so small a rôle
in affairs of this kind. That early marriages do not indeed
of themselves bestow the happiness of love is shown
here; for as a rule the age at which they marry is
eighteen for the men and sixteen for the women. A result
of the extreme youth of these marriages is that the “old
man,” the head of the family, is often a man less than
forty years old and who uses to the full extent his power
and the respect which must be shown to him. For a
long time past he has sent his sons into the fields and
been at home alone with the sons’ wives. For centuries
he has gone about among all the young women in the
house, like a Turkish sultan, and none of them has dared
to defy him. A whole range of Russian national songs
treat of the cane of the father-in-law. The result is that
the Russian peasant never has treated woman as man’s
equal helpmate. The proverbs run: “Love your wife as
your own soul and beat her like your fur!” — “If you
cannot thrash your wife, whom can you thrash?” — “It
is my wife — my thing.” — Even in the seventeenth
century the father, on giving his daughter in marriage, bought
a new whip to give her the last domestic discipline coming
from him, and then gave it solemnly to the son-in-law,
with the direction to use it early and unsparingly. On
entering the bridal chamber, the ceremonial custom was
for the bridegroom to give his bride one or two lashes
over the shoulders, with the words: “Now forget your
father’s will and suit yourself to mine.” The national
song, nevertheless, directs him to take a “silken whip.”

What a stride it is from this to the conceptions of the
youngest generation about the right of women freely to
give themselves away and freely recede, and their ideas
of the common work of the sexes for the freedom and
happiness of the masses!

And yet, if the distance is enormous between these
alert and sprightly young people and those for whom
and among whom they would labor, the contrast between
an <i>intelligentia</i> with its system of morals and the official
world of Russia, which holds in its hands the whole
administration and all the material means of the country,
is not less immense.

Here is an intelligent <i>élite</i>, for whom the rule of
ethics is not the official patent morality, — nay, even not
the legal — for the motto, “Nothing unlawful,” is, for
many who belong to it, the stamp of the Philistine, —
but for whom above all ethics stands that which they
call <i>the divine spark</i>, — this spark which Dostoyevski
traces out and finds even in criminals and the partially
insane, and for whom morality is what they call “the
unconscious condition,” — that is, that in which the
individual does what is right without exertion, without
self-conquest, because it agrees with his nature.

Imagine an <i>intelligentia</i> with these rules of ethics, as
a spiritual guiding power in a state which is ruled and
governed as Russia, — where the most ignorant bigotry,
in the darkest of the Christian creeds, is the law and
fashion, which from the court is diffused downwards, and
where a single man’s will, even if he has none, is the
supreme controlling law.

These two underlying powers are drawing away from
each other on every side. What does it lead to? Can
any mortal draught the parallelogram of these forces, the
resulting tendency and its course?

We are reminded, in considering it, of the passage in
Gogol's “Dead Souls,” where Tchitchikof’s <i>kibitka</i> is
lost in the distance, driven with mad haste, —

“And dost not thou, Russia, drive away like a <i>troïka</i>,
not to be overtaken! The road smokes behind thee, the
bridges creak. Thou leavest all behind thee. The
beholders, amazed, stop and say, — ‘Was it a flash of
lightning ? what means this blood-curdling course? what is
the secret power in these horses? What kind of horses
are you? have you whirlwinds in your withers? have
you recognized tones from above, and do you now force
your iron limbs, without touching the earth with your
hoofs, to fly hence through the air, as if inspired by a
God? Russia, answer whither thou art driving?’ There
comes no answer. We can hear the little bells on the
horses tinkling strangely; there is a groaning in the air,
increasing like a storm; and the Russian land continues
its wild flight, and the other nations and kingdoms of
the earth step timorously aside, without checking its
career.”

<h2><small>V.</small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> the spring of 1887, the fiftieth anniversary of the
poetic <i>début</i> of the old poet Polonski was celebrated in
St. Petersburg. This festival offered an opportunity of
obtaining a glimpse of the official world, and of becoming
acquainted, at the same time, with many of the literary
and artistic celebrities of Russia.

Yakof Petrovitch Polonski (born 1820) is very highly
esteemed, and is exceedingly popular as a lyric poet.
He, Maikof, and Plestcheyef are the leading living lyric
poets of Russia of the older generation. The last (born
1825), like Dostoyevski, belonged to the “Petrashevskians,” 
who were sentenced to death in 1849; but, by
commutation of his sentence, he was sent to the Urál
and put into the Orenburg battalion of the line. It was
not till 1857 that he was restored to his rights of
inheritance and rank, and given permission to reside at the
capital of the country. Plestcheyef to this day belongs
to the liberal group in St. Petersburg. Polonski and
Maikof, on the contrary, have a close connection with
the government. This does not imply that they have at
any time participated in politics or cherished principles
hostile to freedom; but, since they are both men of
moderate means, and it is just as impossible in Russia as
in smaller countries to live as a lyric poet, even by the
aid of an occasional novel, the government endeavored
to improve their condition by giving each of them an
office in the censorship. This combination of lyric poet
and literary censor, which is so tragi-comic in itself, is
decidedly a peculiarity of Russia. In any other country
it would be taken for granted that if any one needed
absolute freedom, it would be a lyric poet, and that if
any one was not adapted to curtail the liberty of others,
it would be he.

More or less weakness of character and poverty have
united to bring these poets to the point of receiving
gratefully the bounty of the government.

Since Polonski was censor as well as government
officer, it could be anticipated that the whole official
world would be present to assist at his jubilee. Since
he was to be honored as the representative of <i>belles-lettres</i>, 
it was not less certain that the larger number of
the authors in St. Petersburg would be present. In fact,
it was only the extreme liberal party, of which the
reviews <i>Vyestnik Yevropui</i> and <i>Sevyerni Vyestnik</i> are the
rallying-points, that did not participate in the festival.
The only really liberal authors who were present sat,
humorously enough, as guests — one even as an honored
guest — between those who had forbidden the publication 
of their books and prevented the delivery of their
lectures.

On one side of Polonski sat Vyshnegradski, then <i>ad
interim</i>, but since fully constituted, minister of finance,
— a fine-looking, elderly man, with broad shoulders, but
with a countenance that did not inspire confidence; and
who, prior to his assuming the office, had been somewhat
criticised. The unthinking mob, which in Russia, as
elsewhere, likes to throw mud at anything which shines,
had set the following absurd report in circulation, and it
obtained general currency, though, naturally, no credit:
It is said that, on his appointment as minister, he was
taken to the Kazán Church, before a celebrated image of
a saint, adorned with jewels, and there was obliged to
take a solemn oath that the treasury of the state should
be sacred to him. He took the oath readily; but by a
strange accident, it is added, after the ceremony, some
diamonds and rubies were missing from the vestments of
the saint. This story is of about the same kind as the
accounts which are found in the Russian national songs,
— of how the Cossack chief Platof pays a visit to the
Emperor Napoleon, in Paris, disguised as a merchant,
gives the <i>Frenchman</i> a description of himself, then leaps
upon his horse and rides away before the emperor’s nose.
But the story is, nevertheless, indicative of the suspicion
which the continual robbery of the public funds by
officials has created among the people, even towards men in
the highest places. A foreign author, who had described
the Russian situation in Poland as that, when eighty
thousand rubles were appropriated for a road, forty
thousand must go into the pockets of the officials,
repeatedly heard in St. Petersburg the answer: “Lucky
fellows, those Poles, if it is really the case there! Since
here, when eighty thousand rubles are appropriated for a
road, eighty thousand goes into the pockets of the
officials.”

Since the Zemstvos have been deprived of jurisdiction
throughout the land, it would seem that stealing goes on,
regardless of consequences, in the most barefaced
manner. It appears to the common people as if every
disorder on the part of the officials escaped punishment now
more than ever before.

By the side of Vyshnegradski sat a patron of literature, 
— a general in uniform, with a face as red as a
lobster, and faience eyes, and expressed his good wishes for
lyric and novelistic literature of the right kind in and
out of Russia.

Polonski, who was placed at the middle of the left
side of the table arranged in the form of a horse-shoe,
is a tall and dignified old gentleman, with a mild,
intellectual countenance, and a long, white beard. His hair,
smoothly combed back, has still preserved its dark color.
He came in with a cane in his hand, for he is slightly
lame; in his face there was a somewhat uneasy
expression of satisfaction at receiving homage. Later, the
expression of pleasure at the consideration which was
shown him broke through all his embarrassment. There
was something childlike in this character, — stamped by
the circumstances under which it had been developed, and
which plainly had many excellent qualities. The
friendship with which Turgenief continually honored him, and
which does honor to his life, could not otherwise be
explained. (The Vesná collection, published by the Danish
author, Thor Lange, contains a series of genial letters
from Turgenief to Polonski.)

Opposite to him at the table sat his brother in Apollo
and in the censorship, Apollon Nikolayevitch Maikof,
with his speech under his arm, with his long, white hair
falling down as German professors sometimes wear it, a
sharply cut countenance with a pure, strong profile. He
rose first and moved a little away from the table and
began to read from his paper, — not, as elsewhere is the
custom, with his face towards the company, but, as was
the case with the later speakers, turned towards the
honored guest, so that those who would hear what was
said must gather in a throng about him. When he came
to the statement of the fact that the Tsar, in honor of
the day, had doubled Polonski’s salary as censor, there
was loud applause from all directions, and with surprising 
servility came shouts of “The hymn! the hymn!”
meaning the national song. They all rose to their feet
and sang it. Then the telegrams were read. When
Katkóf’s came, it was received with demonstrations of
shouts and applause, — and a silence, not less significant,
on the part of some. When these shouts of joy for a man
whose name is the symbol for every suppression and
reaction in the interests of their fatherland were heard,
it could be seen that in this hall there was assembled an
extract of everything in Russia that gags, paralyzes, and
brags, although on that account the presence of many
distinguished and finely cultured men is not to be denied.

Among those who shook their heads and looked
inquiringly at their neighbors, when the mention of
Katkóf’s name awaked such a storm of applause, was the
celebrated Slavophile, Orestes Miller, the historian, a
small, grizzled man, with a round head, animated features,
and an expression of sense and enthusiasm, united with
the conservatism of a professor. He has long sought to
occupy a middle standpoint betwreen the fanatical
Slavophiles of the Aksakovian school, who see an original
production in all Russian works, and the scholars who
investigate in the European methods, like Stasof, who,
as, for instance, in the question about the subjects of the
Russian epic poems, has supported the view that all this
is the echo of tradition wrhich a long time previous had
been spread among the most distant nations of antiquity.
Miller has written a valuable essay on the greatest
national hero of the Kief-cycle, Ilia of Murom. In the
more modern literature, Dostoyevski is his ideal, and he
was just expounding to his neighbor at the table the
excellence of that author’s “Karamazof Brothers,” when
he was interrupted by the shouts for Katkóf. He little
suspected that not a year after he should receive his
dismissal from his professorship at the University at St.
Petersburg because in two introductory lectures in 
succession he had stamped the character and effect of the
Katkofskian re-action as injurious to Russia, — oblivious
of the fact that the Tsar himself, in a letter to Katkóf’s
widow just after his death, had called him <i>Russia’s
greatest patriot</i>.

Not far from him sat a younger man, whom love of
literature alone had brought into this circle, a wild and
free bird in defiance of anybody, Vsevolod Garshin. He
was strongly built, dark-haired, with the stamp of a
self-educated man. He rolled his eyes about in a strangely
watchful and wild manner: he had had repeated attacks
of insane melancholy, and fears were entertained for his
future condition. On no one did the reception given to
Katkóf make so profound an impression as on him. But
who could then imagine that, not many months later, the
almost universal servile attitude of the Russian press at
the death of Katkóf should be the occasion which caused
him permanently to lose control over his faculties. The
panegyrics over a man whose influence he regarded as
the root of all evil in the new era of the Russian Empire
gave a shock to his brain. At first he continually
groaned, — “No, I should never have believed that our
press was despicable to that extent, to that extent
low-minded: — What shall we do? what shall we then do?”
And again and again he broke out in sobs. After that
he sat for half a year in his black melancholy, and wept
continually. When he was asked the reason, he answered,
“I weep for Russia.” — In the hope of causing his
recovery, the directors of the railroads, by which he was
employed, gave him a leave of absence and the means to
travel south; but, the day before he was to set out, the
sick man put an end to his life by throwing himself over
the stairs from the upper story of the house in which he
lived with his young wife.

After Maïkof, a stranger to Polonski, who happened
to be present, spoke, by invitation, and, although there
was nothing in the speech, received hearty applause. It
was not difficult to make an impression of eloquence
here; for it seems that, with the exception of the
advocates, no man in Russia has the talent of speaking, nor
the courage to try. Not a single Russian arose who did
not have his speech on paper in his hands, and who did
not read it. Even among the advocates, there are not
many who have a reputation for eloquence; perhaps the
best known are Alexander Passauvert, “the great
advocate,” Prince Urussof, Koni, and Utin. Yet it is
significant that he who is most popular and makes the
most money is the Pole Spasovitch, author of the volume
which treats of Poland in Pypin’s great work about
Slavic literature. It is certain, in any case, that even if
in Russian Poland, as here, all public and political life,
which are indeed the natural school of eloquence, are
wholly prohibited, yet the Poles have access to three
parliaments out of Russia; and their natural gifts, from
ancient times, lead them in the direction of weighing
and selecting their words. One will seldom hear a more
eloquent man than the Pole Joseph Koscielski: he is a
member of the Prussian House of Lords and of the
German parliament.

Among the persons present at the festival for
Polonski, whose acquaintance a foreigner would be interested
to make, the old lyric poet Pleshcheyef must also be
mentioned, — a man of large frame, with white hair and
beard, one of the few old men in Russia who have been
true to the convictions of their youth; and Dostoyevski’s
widow, a lady between forty and fifty years old, with
delicate, regular features, who must have appeared to
great advantage by the side of the irregular, plebeian,
good-natured physiognomy of her husband. An uncomfortable 
husband he must have been, even less fitted for
matrimony than poets in general, and fully as irregular
as any one to whom it has never occurred to make his
books a series of arguments for mystical religion and
pious asceticism.

A short time after, there was a similar festival in
jubilee-delighting Russia, with speeches and telegrams,
for the old marine painter Aïvasovski, whom they would
thank for “having raised Russian art to the height it
now occupies.” Aïvasovski is chiefly indebted for his
fame to the fact that there are very few Russians who
have thoroughly known the ocean, and many who have
never even seen it. None of them were qualified to
criticise or sit in judgment on his marine views. When he
was young, he may have painted some fine pictures; later,
he has only repeated himself, and manufactured his
seaviews as waffles are served, — hot and fresh on the spot.
Always the same story; always the same waves, seen
from right or left, in sun or moonlight. The exhibition
of his painting, some time ago, in Copenhagen, was a
<i>fiasco</i> not without good cause.

A day or two after the jubilee, he responded with a
dinner to one hundred and fifty persons; consisting of
those who had been present at the festival in his honor,
the whole Academy, the Minister of Education, the
President of the Synod, the Tsar’s tutor, Pobyedonostsef,
and others. Each guest received Aïvasovski’s portrait,
a large photograph, representing him sitting before a
canvas, and this canvas, one-fourth the size of an octavo
page, pasted to the photograph, was a painting by his
own hand. In this manner he distributed to his guests
one hundred and fifty small paintings: waves, shipwrecks, 
moonlight effects on the water. The rector of
the university delivered a long, ineffably silly speech.
He said that the Black Sea might vanish (be dried up?),
but the memory of it would never disappear; for it was
immortalized by Aïvasovski’s paintings. The press, on
this occasion, was represented only by Suvórin, the
editor of <i>Novoye Vremya</i>, as the other newspapers
had been unable to see in Aïvasovski an artist of any
rank.

Taken as a whole, the official world in Russia is
doubtless no worse than elsewhere. The spirit of deference,
timid snobbery, and arrogant leaders of society are its
characteristics everywhere. At the same time, perhaps
the lack of culture and the natural simplicity is even
greater, which is the more unfortunate because the
higher officials in Russia have a far greater
uncontrolled range of power than in any other European
country.

Russia, as is well known, is divided into departments:
Russia proper, into fifty; Poland, into ten; — and on the
frontier three, four, and five of them are placed under
one governor-general. In addition, the largest cities,
like St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kharkof, Odessa, have
governors-general, who possess a military dictatorship.
Until the abolition of serfdom, in 1861, the governor was
the absolute ruler in his department, — a lesser Tsar,
over about a million and a half inhabitants. Since then,
the situation is changed only to the extent that he is
surrounded by a group of heterogeneous committees of
control. But the whole of this apparatus is of extremely
slight practical importance, since nearly all of these
committees consist of officials under the governor, or of
other officials of low rank, the watchword of whose life
is and must be official servility. Instead of sharing in
the governor’s responsibility, these committees 
diminish it, without limiting the full extent of his power
to any perceptible extent. It is only necessary to
read Saltykov’s gory description of Russian provincial 
governors, in the work, “Our Pompadours,” to
get an idea of the plane of intellectual development
which these men occupy, and of what can happen any
day.

To this must be added that, even since the legal
reforms of 1864, the governor has retained the
privilege of reporting to the Minister of the Interior the
persons whom, “in the interest of the public welfare,”
he desires to send to the distant provinces of the empire
by the administrative process, — a privilege not limited
to him, since “the third section of his Majesty’s private
Department of Justice,” the secret police, who have the
superintendence both of the officials and their
subordinates, have the right, without judgment or evidence,
to send to prison or to exile every one who is suspected
by them. How is it possible that such institutions
should not bring to the surface all that is evil and
cowardly, hidden away in human nature, in those who,
at the same time, represent the machinery of state and
are in a situation to place others under its wheels, and
must themselves continually take precautions not to
share the same fate?

It is quite true that there are Russian officers of high
rank who, from their judgment and humanity or from
their strong sense of justice and plain manner of
proceeding, understand how to make themselves respected in the
most difficult circumstances, like the distinguished
Governor of Warsaw. On the other hand, there can scarcely
be any doubt that the Governor-General of Poland,
General Gurko, possesses very few qualifications for his high
office, or that old Prince Dolgorukof, Governor-General of
Moscow, discharges his duties badly. He is an extremely
obliging and polite old gentleman to foreigners, and yet
he has a stamp of shallowness and vanity, which makes
a painful impression, when we remember that the weal
and woe of so many people depend on the state of his
emotions and judgment. That he has many friends
among the rich, conservative merchants of the city was
shown by the exhibition, in his ante-chamber, of
complimentary presents, — a collection of costly gifts sent to
him on his jubilee, — which filled one great case after
another. But when tact and magnanimous forbearance
are demanded, official zeal would evidently run away
with him.

An incident which happened in the autumn of 1887
plainly showed this. A concert was given at the
university, in which an orchestra of the students took part. In
the midst of a solemn pianissimo passage, the sound of
two blows on the ear were heard. It was a student who
gave them to Inspector Brysgalof, — “an impertinent
camel,” as one of the professors called him, a creature of
Katkóf, who had done all he could to deserve and excite
the hatred of the students. The blows were accompanied
by the words: “From all the students.” — There was a
general commotion; the police, Cossacks, all were called
up to prevent the young men from escaping from the
university. It came to a general fight: many students
were struck and wounded in the courtyard, when they
resisted arrest.

The whole affair was taken as a good excuse for the
authorities still further tightening the reins by which
the young men at the university are driven. No less
than eighty-six students were exiled on this account by
Prince Dolgorukof. What remained after this kind
of a thorough purification were the extreme 
conservatives, who are more autocratic than the government
itself, who lament from the bottom of their souls the
liberation of the serfs, and who, according to
circumstances, mix a dose of Slavophilism or of Panslavism in
their way of looking at political life.

<chapter name="VI">
<h2><small>VI.</small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> Russia, as elsewhere, it is not the official world with
which the foreigner has the greatest desire to become
acquainted. He seeks in every large city, as soon as
possible, to be introduced to those whom the inhabitants
themselves regard as the <i>élite</i>. As I have elsewhere
expressed it: There is always a great difference between
the tea which the Chinese drink and that wrhich is sold
throughout the rest of the world. He who is fond of
tea will in every China seek for the tea drunk by the
natives.

The foreigner, who, after having become acquainted
writh one Slavic race, comes to another, soon sees that, in
order to understand the new race thoroughly, he must
make use of the one already known as a standard of
comparison. For only thus can he find the resemblance,
without which all comparison is meaningless. By
comparison with the qualities of the intellectual aristocracy
in Warsaw could the peculiarities of the most advanced
and interesting persons in St. Petersburg and Moscow be
grasped in their delicacy. The Russians have very few
qualities in common with the Scandinavians and the
Germans; and even with the Finns, who live under the
same rule, and generally use the same language, there is
hardly any similarity. The attitude of Finland to Russia
has been admirably compared to that of an honest, quiet
tradesman, who has lived sensibly but monotonously and
a little tediously, to that of a rollicking student, at one
time dissolute and then famished, ready for all sorts of
follies, but also for business, and who is always thinking
more of the problem of human life than of the rent he
has to pay. The capital of Finland, in spite of the
differences and battle of the languages and what revolves
about it, on a flying visit makes a predominating
Scandinavian impression on a foreigner. It is certainly true
that a large, free, cosmopolitan culture is found among the
best educated Finns, partly owing to their close
connection with a power of the world which it would be quite
impossible to find in a place of the same size in a
Scandinavian country. Nevertheless, frivolity, slander, and
philistinism flourish here, as in other parts of the North.
There is no real standpoint of comparison with Russia
to be found here.

With Poland it is entirely different. Nay, the
similarity at first sight is so striking that it overshadows the
dissimilarities, and conceals the Russian peculiarities.
But, in order to find it, we must begin by eliminating all
the traits which the Poles and Russians have in common.

In this way we naturally approach the qualifications
which have any precise character; but they are not so
insignificant as they may seem. The common observer
sees no difference between the cultured classes of the
European nations. As he moves among these people,
who are everywhere dressed in the same manner, and
who everywhere observe the same rules of life and of
politeness, they seem to him the same; and even if he
thinks he discovers some differences, they seem in reality
to be purely accidental. On the other hand, he who is
inclined to critical comparison, and is, therefore,
accustomed to discriminate between essential and unessential
qualities, typical and accidental traits, and is skilled in
tracing the individual propensities back to the national,
and these again to the characteristics of the race, will
always be on the alert to avoid hasty generalizations:
he looks through the skin, hears through the word, and
constantly corrects one impression by the aid of another.
If, for instance, he would give his impressions of a great
capital, like Berlin or Warsaw, then perhaps for months
he would fasten his eyes on lists of hundreds and
hundreds of men and women whom he has known, while he
constantly points out their characteristics to himself,
compares these with each other and with characteristics
of a like number of individuals of other nations, to find
out the most fundamental traits and the common
characteristics. It is thus that the natural scientist finds by
comparison the constituent qualities of the different
kinds of animals.

At every single personality, every single trait, or every
group of traits, which is observed, we must ask ourselves,
“Could not this be found outside of Russia?” After
that which is common to the human race has been
determined, then that which is common to the Slavic races,
then that which the aristocracy or peasants in all
countries have in common, then comes the investigation into
that which is peculiarly national.

In the first conversations, the foreigner will scarcely
find the men who pass for the most clever in Russia
cleverer than those who are regarded as the most gifted
in Warsaw; and he is more likely to find them less
gifted.

The essential trait, to which attention is called
earliest, is, without doubt, that the chief interests of the
Russians are modern. The chief interests in Warsaw
are not of this kind, as there Poland — a historic thing,
the dream about a past which shall be made into a
future — absorbs the thoughts of the best people. In
Russia hardly anything relating to the past is thought
about. Within the Russian <i>intelligentia</i> the historic
sense is even perceptibly weak. Peter the Great, even,
had done his part to saw it off, or rather to pluck it up
by the roots. That the men of revolutionary ideas of
Russia lack it, is in part because the modern founders
of the empire had shaped its tendency in the direction
of the present, — the newest, as the only thing at hand.
To this extent he is to be regarded as the father of the
so-called nihilism; and the Slavophiles have thus one
more reason for regarding him with ill will and horror.

The Russian intelligence, moreover, is less unhappily
situated than the Polish, because it is not hemmed in by
any foreign and hostile nationality. It has connections
in the official circle — nay, quite up in the family of the
Tsar; and it is by no means so denationalized as it was
in the first ten years of the century.

For example, the young Duke George Alexander (of
Mechlenburg), son of the Princess Imperial Katharina
Mikhailovna, grandson of the celebrated Princess
Imperial Helen, and permeated with traditions from the time
of his grandmother, is not infrequently met in liberal
circles. Although he is a prince of the imperial family,
he does not hesitate to make the first call on a foreigner
who does not belong to the nobility, if he thinks that
the acquaintance would be of any advantage to him.
He is a young man of large and sound culture, with
many interests. A more unconventional officer than he
would probably be sought for in vain in the Russian
army. His mother’s palace in St. Petersburg, by its size,
reminds one of Christianborg in Copenhagen. She is
also the owner of large estates in different parts of
Russia, and the young prince impresses one as being
well acquainted with Russia. He is polished, quiet, and
intelligent; his manners present an attractive mingling
of German solidity and Russian intellectual freedom.
He is an interesting illustration of how the intellectual
currents which are blended in the highest circles of
Russia in our time result in a half cosmopolitan, half
national culture.

His grandfather, the Prince Imperial Mikhail, and his
elder brother, Nicholas, were taught by the well known
Swiss, Cæsar La Harpe, the same person who had
previously been the tutor of Alexander the First, and in
their schoolboy days received a thorough course in the
liberal culture of the eighteenth century. So completely
were the young imperial princes to be educated without
regard to the traditions of Christianity, that, as is shown
by the memoirs (edited by Durof) prepared for the
Tsaritsa Katharina describing the methods of instruction
adopted by La Harpe, the following was taught to them
as to the founder of the Christian religion: “Jesus,
surnamed the Christ, a Jew, from whom the Christian
sect takes its name.”<footnote>Jésus, surnommé le Christ, juif, dont la secte des Chrétiens tire le
nom.</footnote> The young imperial princes,
however, were forced by the tediousness of their teacher
to let the philosophy he taught them go in at one ear
and out at the other, and to employ all their leisure
hours in the drill yard, where the beating of drums and
the parades were their chief delight. Mikhail, who had
some mathematical talent, became a zealous artillery
officer, and still was no more absorbed in the peculiarly
military problems than in the arts and sciences of
peace. He would have readily given utterance to his
older brother’s memorable sentence, “I detest war: it
spoils the armies.”<footnote>Je déteste la guerre: elle gâte les armées.</footnote> Reviews and parades, orders and



epaulets, were everything to him in his youth. When
Nicholas became Tsar, from enthusiastic zeal for his
authority, he excluded his brother from every position
whatever, that was in the slightest degree influential;
and, from indignation at this, the latter on all occasions
expressed himself in bitter derision about his
surroundings, sneering at everything and everybody, with the
reckless irony of a discontented man.

It was to this man that in the last year of the life of
Alexander I. (1824) the young Princess of Würtemberg,
who on being received into the Greek Church took the
name Helena Pávlovna, was married. During the
twenty-five years of her married life, she was compelled
to suppress all her interests, and to be apparently
absorbed in court festivals, audiences, and tedious drives,
and dared to occupy herself with reading and music and
to enjoy the society of artists and scientists only during
the time which etiquette dealt out as sparingly as possible.
At the age of forty-five she was a widow, and seemingly
lived some years only for her daughter Katharina
Mikhailovna and the children whom the latter had from
her marriage with the somewhat bigoted re-actionist,
Duke George of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. At the death of
the Czar Nicholas, a new epoch was begun in her life,
and she opened her palace to everything intellectual to
be found in the different parties in St. Petersburg. The
leaders not only of the Slavophile, but of the liberal
party frequented her house. Conversation there was
spirited and without restraint. The mistress of the
house was still handsome, and she liked to see
fine-looking men about her. Her household contained only
handsome men, among them Abaza, afterwards Minister
of Finance. She also patronized the distinguished
vocalist, who afterwards became the wife of the latter,
and now as Julia Feodorovna Abaza is one of the ladies
in waiting at her daughter’s court. By the side of the
politicians of the different shades, artists and
scientists, Russian and foreign, had free access to her house.
For a long time it was the custom that distinguished
artists or scholars who came to St. Petersburg took up
their residence, by her invitation, in the beautiful
palace at Mikhailof Square. She had lost the power of
continuous activity or work during that long period of
her life when her whole existence had been absorbed by
the etiquette of the old court. But interest in and love
of knowledge was fresh in her to the last.

It is her inheritance which Katharina Mikhailovna’s
heir has entered upon with greater earnestness and
penetration in spite of his youth and in spite of his
oppressive situation under the existing Russian rule.<footnote>Comp. (Julius Eckhardt): <i>Aus der Petersburger Gesellschaft</i>,
5th ed., p. 30 and following.</footnote>

A point like this makes one feel sharply the distance
from Russian Poland, where no thread from the world of
intelligence reaches completely within the court circles.

At the present time there is no central salon in
St. Petersburg. Formerly, Countess Alekseï Tolstoi
formed such a centre. The widow of the celebrated
poet, one of the most cultivated women in Russia, is
now an elderly woman and no longer an attraction to
society. Among the advanced Russians it is the style
nowadays to answer questions relating to that subject
with: “A salon! a circle! an intellectual aristocracy!
Really, what do you expect? There is nothing of the
kind here. The house where you live is an oasis. All
around it is a desert.” — And if you ask for their great
men, where they are to be found and seen, the answer
readily slips out: “I don’t know them; I have never


heard of them. We are perhaps in advance of the
Germans in this one thing, that we do not have great men
like them. We lack a Felix Dahn, a Gustav Freytag,
and Julius Wolff, and so on. We do not have the solid
and learned, earnest men, who on the other side of the
frontier write novels in four volumes, and historical
works in fifteen. There is an utter want of that kind
of genius among us. We have not even the Prussian
<i>Feldwebel</i> with clinched fists, in whom our neighbors
see the new Pericles. He is deeply indebted to us. The
stupidity of our statesmen is his genius. To that extent
you can find his genius here.”

This trait of depreciating and speaking ironically
about themselves is of very frequent occurrence among
the progressive Russians, more frequently than among
the Poles of the present time, and united with an irony
pointed at foreign self-conceit, which it is difficult to
find elsewhere.

Just as the Russians, as a rule, do not extol the
geniality or the industry of their countrymen, so also the
more refined and more sceptical among them glorify just
as little their intellectual powers or their trustworthiness.
“Look out for a Russian,” you will hear in St.
Petersburg: “he has more imagination than intellect, and more
intellect than moral sense.” This is hardly true about
the common people of Great Russia, whose quick
apprehension, constancy in work, and perseverance in adversity,
are crowned by the most meritorious virtue, — a great
gentleness, — and who, however credulous they may
be, and however easily on that account they may be
frightened for the moment, still have an equipoise in
their nature, a consistency in their method of thought,
and a quiet courage, which makes them composed and
steady in times of danger.

Among the cultivated Russians, on the contrary, the
foreigner will often enough meet with instability and
capriciousness, of which the young men of Turgenief
afford so many examples. Little traits which illustrate
it will be at his service by the scores: —

A young Russian sees a young Englishwoman on a
public promenade in Heidelberg. He does not rest until
he has won her, and she gives him her hand. They
come to Russia. He has little property and does not
care to work to any extent. He has hardly passed the
honeymoon before he declares that there is no
congeniality, no affinity to be found between him and his wife.
They then live in different cities: he amuses himself as
well as he can in St. Petersburg; she remains in
Schüsselburg, educates her daughter, in the English style, to
independence, lives constantly in recollection of her
husband. He amuses himself, travels, as a choice lies
in a boat on the Black Sea and dreams. He is now
forty years old and has not yet found his career. He
has for a long time been a farmer, but wishes to change
his occupation and become an advocate.

Is not that Russian? asks the foreigner. It is human,
and common to the Slavs. A Pole has certainly not
very infrequently done about the same. A Frenchman
might, I dare say, become tired of an Englishwoman,
but would hardly enter upon a new career at forty. A
German would apply for a divorce, remain at his trade,
and immediately marry again. It is Slavic, it is true,
but hardly peculiarly Russian.

“Tell me your family drama,” says the foreigner to
his Russian acquaintances. They tell a story like this:
There were two brothers L., of the aristocracy, one
married but childless. His wife becomes <i>enceinte</i>, and
informs her husband that his brother is the father of the
child. A duel between the two brothers follows, in
which blood is spilt, but no one killed. The wife leaves
her husband, who is living and has lived with a
ballet-dancer, marries the brother, and by him has a large
number of children. The fathers and mothers in law are
delighted. They immediately received the newly
married pair with open arms, and society approves of what
has been done. Is this Russian, or not?

That which is specially Russian must be the contentment 
and tolerance of the fathers and mothers in law.

Professor T. of the University became infatuated with
a lady who was married to one of his colleagues. He
moved into the same apartments with Mrs. M. They
had both their names on the door, each received in their
rooms, and were invited everywhere together.

This is more characteristic. In the capitals of other
countries marriage would have been essential.

Baroness L. was first married to a young, fine-looking
man, who held a high official position, left him to marry
his superior officer, who was thirty years older than
herself. Since this marriage she for some years travelled
about with a young Austrian count of a celebrated
family, then came back to Russia, while her husband by
his official situation is tied in Madrid. In St.
Petersburg she has a young artist living in her house, sees a
young poet every day, shows a lively sympathy for
several other men, and is not the less, after some hesitation
on the part of society, received everywhere, being still
young and remarkably pretty. She drives to a ball
at the house of the minister of Foreign Affairs, and sits
there dressed as a gypsy queen, with a gold ring on her
forehead, takes an active part in the social life of the
highest circles, and makes eyes to the young gentlemen.
The next day she sits clothed in a simple woollen dress,
without ornaments, knitting a stocking in a garret with
a poor gray-haired lady, who knows the addresses of all
the exiled, and takes care of money sent to them. She
writes a novel for a prominent French periodical, about
interesting countesses from Russian <i>high life</i>, who fall
and rise again, and she writes pamphlets at one kopek
for the collection of popular writings in Moscow. She
stands on almost confidential footing with several young
men of the radical wing of the liberal party; but on still
more confidential footing with the prefect of police of a
great city, through whom she can and does obtain
pardons in large numbers.

This combination ought not to exist outside of Russia.

Nicholas Y., a very well educated young man, had
revolutionary tendencies in the sixties. A young girl,
very handsome and enthusiastic, fled out of the country
with him. She was then a Nihilist, had taken part in
commotions of the students, accompanied him from
place to place — “civilly married” to him, as she called
it, which means in Russia not married at all. They went
to London. When they returned, in 1878, both were
changed. He, a capitalist, re-actionist, working to get
exorbitant railroad grants in Bulgaria. She, exclusive,
formal, an Anglomaniac, correct and strikingly dressed,
with several diamond ornaments on a dress of black
velvet. It would not have been believed that they had
ever led a life of independent and rebellious ideas and
emotions. On his death some years after, it is said that
she found among his papers several which placed his
character in a light of which she had never dreamed,
and which was unfavorable to her. Then she had
another transformation, sought the most extreme liberal
circles, and has now wholly devoted herself to the
literature and politics of the progressives, declares that she is
living her youth over again, because she believes that in
the present times she finds once more the vigorous
impulses from the sixties.

This inconstancy, which emanates from the very
receptive nature of the cultivated Russian, is less
surprising than elsewhere, and is accepted by the customs
of the country.

This class, moreover, in the higher stratum of society
also not infrequently manifests a certain cynicism in the
presence of brides by the “civil” rules to be found
elsewhere only among Bohemians.

Critic F. reads aloud in company an article about M.’s
poems. M., who enjoys a certain prestige as a lyric poet,
is a small, robust, thick-set man, about thirty years old,
with a dark Jewish-Mongolian countenance, a kindly,
attractive smile, and rather embarrassed demeanor. His
poems are ponderous, rich in sentences, and belong to a
kind of lyric usually characterized as deep. The critic
positively overwhelmed the absent poet with his praise.
In bombastic, incoherent prose, he extolled the wonderful 
beauties, which were not to be found in reading the
poems through the first time. The comic aspect of the
situation was that Mrs. M., who was divorced the
previous year, is present, listens to the panegyrics upon her
ex-husband, and by the side of him she now prefers
expressed to the author of the article her objections to
his view of the subject.

One must go to the South German circles of actors and
authors to find anything like this. That which bears
the special Russian stamp on it is perhaps that no one in
the company seems to find anything out of the way in
it. It is a peculiarity of Russia that, when a marriage
tie is dissolved, it is generally the wife who desires to
enter upon a new union, and very often the husband, in
order to make this possible for her, assumes the blame,
so that a divorce may be decreed, although he thereby
makes it impossible to be married again himself. The
following is a case which happened last year: an
estimable and finely educated advocate, who was married to
a young princess, received the confession from her that
she was in love with an officer of the guard. He
declared himself to be the guilty party, and she, by
reason of this accommodation, not very easy for him,
married her lover without impediment.

These glimpses of fundamental traits from the St.
Petersburg family dramas shape themselves into a
typical picture. But the peculiarities are brought into the
clearest light when we compare prominent Russian
individuals of the higher circles with prominent Poles
of the same class.

The typical Polish nobleman of our time is a grand
gentleman whose practical interests are agricultural,
whose diversions are amusements and the theatre,
whose intellectual interests are concentrated in the
advancement of the cause of the Catholic Church
and thereby of the Polish aristocracy. To him the
Church is the precious pledge of the nationality, and in
his mind the aristocracy stands as the indispensable
leader of the nation. He publishes, at his own expense,
some old national work, he subsidizes the national
theatre in Posen or the Polish press in Warsaw, enters into
alliance with Rome and with the Jesuits, — that is, if he
is a zealous Conservative and a zealous Pole. Otherwise,
he only thinks of amusing himself, lives for the ballet,
never misses a horse race, marries the daughter of some
rich Jewish banker to gild his tarnished coat-of-arms,
and then continues the life of his youth with greater
dignity and fewer creditors. He never does any real
work. The old aristocratic disdain and aversion for
labor exist to this day unchanged in Poland. A young
Polish nobleman who works is cited everywhere as a
phœnix.

It is quite different in Russia. In the aristocracy
here, for the most part, the broad-shouldered, persistent
muzhik shines out.

Here is a type: He is of a princely family; that is to
say, he belongs to one of the only half a hundred
Russian families who are of real princely blood, because
they are descended from the old rulers of the country.
He has inherited hardly any property. Without any
trace of the Ranudo-like<footnote>Don Ranudo (read backwards <i>O du Nar</i> “Oh, thou fool!”) is the
principal character in Holberg’s comedy of that title.</footnote> disinclination to work, which
is the characteristic of the Polish nobleman, he studies
engineering first in Russia, then in Germany; on
his return goes to work with an axe in his hand,
builds bridges, and lays out railroads, at first in the
employment of others, and afterwards on his own
account. Not that he loves work on its own account.
As a practical Russian, he means to become rich, very
rich. He becomes a manufacturer, gives up his
manufactory to become a financier; as a speculator on the
exchange develops a sagacity and prudence which are
not surpassed by old bankers; has the keenest scent for
money-making, and at forty years of age is a millionnaire.
He is a practical and coarse-grained nature, a mathematical 
head, a calculator of probabilities, who has never
known any kind of enthusiasm, and has never had a
glimpse of artistic taste. If he travels to Italy, it is
not to enjoy nature, or see works of art: he is to be
found dallying with roulette at Monaco.

He is practical but not narrow-minded, and not 

depraved. He is not like the Polish landed proprietors,
who in Galicia (until in more recent times it was
prohibited) tortured their Little-Russian peasants, and
prevented their going to church, by locking the doors of the
Greek church to them, and giving the keys to the Jews,
so that the peasants must buy them back in order to
worship the Lord on their festivals; — he has himself no
kind of religion, and he is willing that all men should
have theirs. Nor is he like the Polish landed proprietor
in Galicia of the present day, who lives by the manufacture 
of spirits, and by forcing as much of it as possible 
into his peasants. His heart is without any sensitiveness; 
he is as harsh as he is obstinate; but he does
no man any harm. In his youth he has been a humanitarian 
— not from emotion, but from force of a process
of reasoning in which the right is the logical justice;
now he is so no longer to that extent, as he no longer
believes in the utility of the efforts of single individuals
in respect to the great sum of social misery, and as he
is entirely incapable of the enthusiasm which leads to
action even if the profit of the action is infinitesimally
small. Very sharp-sighted as he is, he feels an almost
personal hostility to all metaphysics; he has written a
book, a sort of philosophy of mathematics, in which he
advocates the necessity of introducing object lessons
into the department of mathematics, and combats the
use of the words line, point, etc., as unreal abstractions.

Like so many persons with mathematical minds, he is
skilled in music, well informed in all musical technics,
conversant with modern music, and eager to hear a great
deal of good music well performed.

As coarse as a peasant, unrefined but not frivolous,
narrow but not shallow, reckless and loving money but
upright and sometimes almost liberal, he is a decided
materialist from conviction in all matters as to which
he has any knowledge. He cannot with calmness hear
even a lady submit to him for consideration personal
immortality as ever so weak a possibility with which
imagination might amuse itself. To the question why
he has preferred the ballet-dancer whom he keeps in
preference to any of the other actresses, he answers:
“She is a bit more tidy than the others,” and it seems
almost to be the moving cause, for in her regard for him
he neither believes nor can believe.

But, in spite of this candid materialism, openly
exposed, this man is far from being an out-and-out
materialist. He would not be a typical Russian if he wholly
lacked an ideal element. And he has it. Tchernuishevski’s 
old book, “What is to be Done?” (“A Vital Question”<footnote>Translated from the Russian by N. H. Dole and S. S. Skidelsky;
published by T. Y. Crowell & Co.</footnote>) 
is his Bible. Its rebellious propositions and contents 
are to him the truth in regard to the traditions of
the old society. He demands, not aloud but in his quiet
thoughts, a reform in the relations of the sexes, would
have that freedom introduced which is proper for a man
of age, who has left the official religion and the official
morals equally far, far in the rear, and there, at this
point of his spiritual life, is a nook where the social
Utopia sprouts and blossoms in shade and twilight.

Next, the following type is more characteristic: he is
also a prince, but probably of Tatar descent; the name
indicates this, but the physiognomy is entirely European.
He is very fine-looking, very elegant, with eyes which,
in spite of his being almost fifty, shine like those of a
youth, or rather like those of a magnetizer. He is
unusually gifted, possessing at once great artistic, linguistic,
and oratorical powers.

Being without money, he chose a practical career while
yet very young. But he met with a mishap at the outset. 
Somewhere in a foreign country, in a semi-private
circle, he had made a speech of a political tendency
which had caused displeasure. On his return home
he was punished by exile to a little country town in
Esthonia, where he was obliged to remain for ten or
twelve years, exclusively limited as to society to men,
of whom not one stood on the same plane of culture as
himself, and shut out from all activity, all development,
and all means of livelihood. At last, he lost all hope of
ever being liberated from his place of exile, and in a sort
of desperation married a young woman of the neighborhood, 
who, indeed, was both pretty and good-hearted, but
separated from him by so deep an abyss in culture, that
she, on her part, has never desired to enter her husband’s
circle in society at St. Petersburg as princess. She lives
only for her home and her son.

He came back finer-looking and more elegant than
ever, thoroughly cured of political enthusiasm. As if in
scorn, freedom was given him in the guise of a government 
appointment in which he must work in its service
directly against that system of thought for which he
had suffered. Cold as ice, materialist in his manner of
thought and in all the relations of life, he has allowed
himself only one passion: the passion for collecting. He
collects books, manuscripts, bronzes, women. In literature 
and art he gives his allegiance to the principle, <i>Art
for the sake of art;</i><footnote><i>L’art pour l’art.</i></footnote> in life, to the principles from the
time of the court of Louis XV. Among French authors,
he specially affects the line of Flaubert, Zola, Huysmans;
among the Russian poets, Andreyevski, a lyric writer,
whose poems are not on emotional subjects, have no 


emotional relations, and who has had the artistic,
exceedingly odd idea of turning a whole novel of Turgenief
into verse.

He has much passion, but hardly a flash of emotion.
He is frank, entirely truthful, — perhaps, except when
it is a question as to his age, — reserved towards men,
open towards women, who worship him, and in whom he
trusts after having educated them. More than one is
bound to him as if by enchantment, although he has
constantly taught them to root out every germ of emotion
as a germ of misfortune, and although his conversation
with them chiefly turns upon his relations to his other
mistresses.

Now and then, this man shuts himself up in his room,
and sits lost in silent adoration of a statuette of a favorite
French author, with a long, thick mustache, more
sincerely loved by him than perhaps any Parisian woman
has ever been. He makes a journey to Paris simply to
buy a particular edition or a single autograph.

He has no convictions outside of the literary and
artistic. But within this circle he has his Russian
enthusiasm as a passion, wholly absorbing him,
irrational in the midst of all his intellectual coldness.

What is common to the Slavs is easily comprehended 
in him. On closer examination and comparison,
that which is essentially Russian may also be
comprehended. In Poland there is an eminent nobleman, K. J.,
who belongs to the same class of men. He is elegant,
cold, prudent, and yet, in certain directions, enthusiastic.
This Pole and this Russian, to every one who knows
them both and is able to compare them, are equally
brilliant; but the Pole is vainer, the Russian more
directly fond of sensual pleasures. There is a remnant
of chivalrous tradition in the Pole, which the Russian
has shaken off. The Russian satiety goes deeper than
the Polish, and at the same time leaves room for more
force. The Pole presents a weak side from his Polish
dilettante desire to distinguish himself in every
department; the Russian is of harder metal. The Polish ideal
is, and continues to be, grace; the Russian, force.

If we now place the two typical Russian characters
sketched here side by side, we shall notice that, however
different they are, they have this in common, that the
anticipation and struggles of their youth have been made
of no avail by circumstances, so that they have been
forced by necessity to be smaller men than they were
framed for, hardened, practical materialists, in no
situation to do anything profitable for others than themselves,
and entertaining their ideals as one cherishes a harmless
eccentricity.

The two currents in Russian intellectual life, which at
once strike every observer, the tendency towards
Western Europe, the disposition to acclimatize and further
develop the general European culture, and the tendency
inward, the national self-absorption, with a hostile
attitude towards “the Gentiles” in the west, are most
plainly personified in those Tsars of great historic
renown, Peter the Great and Nicholas, two fundamental 
Russian types.

If you go still farther back, you find both these
characteristics united in the old Muscovite Tsars, Iván
III. and Iván IV. the Terrible, the latter being
especially important. He has well been characterized as a
combination of Louis XI. of France and Henry VIII.
of England: a mystical, bloody tyrant and prudent
monarch like the former, and having about as many
wives as the latter. It looks as if Peter the Great
broke with all the traditions from the old Muscovite
princes when he began his violent reforms. And their
coarseness, stubbornness, power, cruelty, and mystical
faith in the might of the Tsar rise up again in this
century in Nicholas. But even then Iván III. turned
to the different European courts in order to procure from
them physicians, artisans, and artists. He invited into
Russia foreign masons, metal-founders, and goldsmiths,
and caused architects and engineers to be brought from
Bologna and Venice. Iván IV. also caused handicraftsmen 
to be brought from various parts of Europe; he
approached England and, in spite of the opposition of
the clergy, brought the art of printing into his empire.
In other words, in the more remote times the contrast
between the condition of the learners to the culture of
Western Europe and the originality in the strongly
marked institutions of the Muscovite Tsar and the
long-bearded Byzantine Russia (governed from a palace which
was a compromise between a barrack and a Greek Catholic 
monastery) was far weaker, far less sharp, than since
that time. It was only when Peter I. at a blow abolishes 
the dignity of the Patriarch, takes from the Greek
Church its landed estates, interdicts the national dress
(nay, the beard), even abandons the long Byzantine
costume in order to dress in an ordinary uniform, and
stations a herd of foreigners, more or less unscrupulous, but
unacquainted with Russian peculiarities, at the head of
all the affairs of the empire, that the tendency towards
Western Europe comes to the front as exclusive. And it
was only when Nicholas wrapped himself up in a decided
hate towards the ideas and reforms which emanated from
the liberal west, when he limited the number of the
students at each of the universities to three hundred,
discontinued instruction in the common constitutional law
of Europe, intrusted the philosophical instruction to the
clergy of the orthodox church, caused the manuscripts
from which history and kindred branches were taught to
pass under the supervision of the censor, and about 1840,
speaking in general terms, would not allow any foreign
newspapers or books to cross the frontier, that the
tendency which closed Russia to Europe was developed
not less exclusively. At that time, it went so far that
all the instructors in geometry in the land were ordered,
when they were teaching the properties of triangles, to
remind their pupils of the holy Trinity, and that the
performance of Lessing’s “Emilia Galotti,” Goethe’s
“Egmont,” and Schiller’s “Fiesco,” were forbidden,
while Rossini’s “William Tell” was allowed only with
the words and title of “Charles the Bold.”

And if the heterogeneous old Russian types appear
sharply in these Czars, Iván III. and Iván IV., Peter and
Nicholas, the modern Russian type of civilization is
shown not less clearly and peculiarly in the person of
Alexander I., with its commingling of energy and
feminine receptivity, — of comprehensive liberalism with
care for all the oppressed and love for the title of
liberator, on the one side, and inertia, the mysticism of Mme.
de Krüdener, a propensity to diffuse conceits or Utopias
like the Holy Alliance, on the other.

This nature in our time is found in many a young
Russian of rank, who travels to Berlin to seek out and
passionately attach himself to Eugene Dühring or
Edward von Hartmann, calls himself positivist or
pessimist and to that extent regards himself as standing on
the heights of modern progress, — but, returned home,
with tearing haste is developed into a Russian high
conservative, enthusiastic for the mission of absolute power,
for the omnipotence of the dominion of the Slav and the
glory of the Greek-Orthodox Church. One of these
younger men, Prince Z., a good man, but not a good
poet, a philosopher, who is accustomed at least once a
year to sit at the feet of Edward von Hartmann,
immediately after Katkóf’s death, sought to succeed him in
charge of his newspaper in Moscow and carry it to
greater lengths in his spirit. He failed in solving this
problem, not from lack of good will but of power.

In the mean time, most significant for Russia, and yet
entirely in analogy to the situation elsewhere, is the
intellectual division into the Western European and
Slavophile groups. It is noticeable and extremely
Russian that the primitive national party of the
Slavophiles, not less than the Western European, owes its
origin to the study of foreign philosophy and poetry.
It is just as true that the great revolutionary spirits of
Russia are a product of the movements which at the
beginning of the thirties took possession of the University
of Moscow. Some of the professors, who had studied
in France and Germany, at that time awakened the
interest of the young students for French socialism and
German philosophy. In all secrecy and from prohibited
books, the young men in separate groups appropriated,
some of them the ideas of Saint-Simon and Fourier, and
others the views of life of Schelling and Hegel. They
gradually divided themselves up in such a manner that
one party, to which Herzen and Bakunin belonged,
united that manner of thought which was nearly allied
to that of Hegel’s most advanced disciples (Ruge,
Feuerbach) to the French Socialistic ideas, which were
proclaimed by Louis Blanc, and in modern French light
literature by George Sand and many others; while, on the
other hand, the natural philosophy of Schelling and the
enthusiasm of the German romanticists for everything
national and old German was kindled in the party of
the Slavophiles, who, wholly in the spirit of these
Germans, demanded a purely Slavic culture and posed as the
representatives of the national principle in its full
sharpness. They cast longing looks back to the time of
Peter the Great. The Muscovite Russia was the home
of their thoughts and dreams. The horrible rule of
Iván the Terrible, in spite of everything, was dearer to
them than the modern liberalism, so destitute of character, 
and parliamentarianism. Their most precious study
was Slavic antiquities, and they thought that they were
diving into the Russian national spirit when they had
dived deep into the Byzantine theology.

To that extent they substantially gave a voice to the
forces and efforts which had existed since the time of
Peter the Great. In those days there was no other
element of opposition than the Raskólnik, that is to say,
the old orthodox party, which, since the time of the
reformer Nikon, had seceded from the State Church and
been split up into numerous sects. The Patriarch Nikon
had wished to regulate the ceremonies of the church.
From his time on, the church demands that its followers
shall cross themselves with three fingers and say three
hallelujahs in succession, and fearful consequences have
overtaken those who resisted. But the Raskólnik have
defied the knout, exile, and execution for their conviction
that one ought to cross himself with two fingers and
only say two hallelujahs in succession. They have
allowed themselves to be burned alive for their conviction, 
for they believed that they would suffer everlasting
damnation if they consented to the number three. It is
even only a year or two since that these sects have been
suffered to have their own chapels and pray as they
pleased — excepting, however, such sects as are still
declared to be dangerous and are persecuted. The most
interesting group of them at the present time is the
so-called <i>Dukhobortsi</i> (Warriors of the Spirit), who are in
the largest numbers in the department Voronezh, and
who were exiled to the Caucasus, to a region without
water. They have shown such energy as to have
converted this desert into one of the most fruitful and
richest regions in the Caucasus. They work in common,
old and young, women and children. They can all read,
although they have no schools; they teach their children
themselves. They do not recognize holy images. They
hang up in their houses, in the corner where the images
are usually placed, an embroidered towel. They do not
carry the cross, but, regarding it as a symbol and
memorial of Christ’s sufferings, detest instead of honoring it.

In time of war they have rendered the greatest
service to the country, when there was need of transporting
supplies or the wounded over the sometimes impassable
roads of the Caucasus; they freely rendered their
service to the State, which had treated them so harshly, and
gave their wagons and time without compensation. Yet
it is characteristic in this connection that in all these
sects the most profound hatred of the heathenish,
heretical institutions of Western Europe has been
nourished.

But the national consciousness and hatred of the
foreign, mounted from the lowest classes of society to the
highest during the great national struggle against
Napoleon, who in 1812 inundated the land with hosts of
Frenchmen, Germans, Italians, and Spaniards. The
great prosperity of the national literature followed the
great contest with its victorious exit, which, both in
Pushkin and in Griboyédof, however much the one is
influenced by Molière and the other by Byron, is
controversially turned against the foreign influence in the
empire. To a certain extent the Slavophiles thus only
continued the agitation, which had been planted and had
reached maturity. This intellectual current must not be
confounded with the Panslavist, to which there is a
certain resemblance in name. The Panslavists themselves
have been European radicals like Bakunin, in so far as
they, in the service of the national cause, to the
advantage of the dissemination of the peculiar Russian
communism and association, wished the union of all the
Slavic races and the foundation of a great Slavic empire,
monarchical or republican. The Slavophiles, on the other
hand, have directed the most vigorous assaults towards
those sympathizing with the Poles in the west; they
represent the narrower Russian national feeling, and
like to look back to the old Byzantine basis of culture
and faith for the Russian national life.<footnote>Comp. Julius Eckhardt: <i>Jungrussich und Altlivländisch; die
russische neue Aera.</i>
</footnote>

If we turn back now to our starting-point, the
comparison between the Russian and Polish intelligence, we
shall see that the Russian intelligence is obliged to make
almost as painful a choice of forces as the Polish. The
dilemma of the modern Polish patriot is this, that, if he
decides to labor uncompromisingly for progress, he
undermines the Catholic Church, and thereby, for the time
being, the Polish nationality, and labors in reality for
the oppressive government, — the force at hand most
hostile to himself and to progress of every kind. If, on
the other hand, he chooses intellectual stagnation, he
plainly sees the danger that the nationality, which is
protected thereby, and of which they were and are so
proud, will fall behind in European culture, and become
antiquated and outstripped.<footnote>Comp. Georg Brandes: <i>Indtryk fra Polen.</i></footnote> The corresponding dilemma



of the progressive Russian patriot is this: to the best
of his ability he would shake off foreign influences.
But at the same time that he considers that what this
brings in its train is ruinous to national originality and
growth, he sees that the Russians are less advanced than
the inhabitants of any of the European countries except
Turkey.<footnote>Eckhardt: <i>Jungrussisch und Altlivländisch</i>, p. 18.</footnote> However strongly he may complain, like
Tchatski, the celebrated typical Russian in Griboyédof's
“The Misfortune of Having Intelligence,” that Moscow
imitates Paris in manners and customs, in language and
modes of expression, in fashions and follies, nevertheless, 
like Tchatski, he winds up by turning abruptly on
the Russians themselves, who feel that they are only fit
to be imitators, and who, when a man has five or six
ideas by means of which he rises above the people, and
dares to express them freely, fall upon him like
barbarians. All the attacks on the intellectual supremacy of
the foreigners become at last an attack on that Russia
which submits to and finds its profit in it. Tchatski,
in his last soliloquy, utters the painful cry, “It is also
my fatherland.” And thousands have ended with this
cry of distress.

In other words, the progressive Russian who desires
the broadening and development of the nationality of
his people, and that the foreign element should be kept
at a distance, soon comes to the conviction that the
fragments of Western European culture in his land are
always worth more than the unquestionable national
roughness and the equally national barbarity. He
cannot indeed distinguish between the people and the
government, for a great people have the government they
deserve. He sees that for whatever finer culture,
scientific insight, and artistic taste he himself possesses, he
is indebted to the civilization of Western Europe, and
that it is the Russian people’s own fault if they have
only used this civilization to varnish the brutality of
their form of government and the barbarity of its
administration. The more nobly and earnestly he wishes for
his country the gifts of justice, humanity, and freedom,
the plainer it becomes to him that they can be obtained
by unremittingly and uncompromisingly opposing the
ruling national tendencies of the century. He feels the
impossibility of wishing for progress and freedom of
thought at the same time with the strengthening of
national feeling in Russia. Not only the sentiment
of fatherland, but that national feeling which he feels
in his heart to be justified here, become re-actionary
from necessity. The freedom-loving patriot can long
enough and enthusiastically enough demand the
development of the people from within. He can only by
virtue of the points of view supplied by the culture of
Western Europe judge what there is in his own
country which ought to be promoted or repressed; and,
wherever he makes his exit, if he desires to see
human and civil rights respected in his land, and to see
strong emotions and productive ideas disseminated and
rooted there, he comes out by returning to the deficient
western culture, only too often caricatured in Russia,
which the sects detest, and which the national party of
the Slavophiles abhors and condemns. For on the
plane of development Russia has at this time reached,
he inevitably finds himself compelled to choose between
the two forces, — either the national with the sacrifice
of the ideal of progressive freedom and culture, or the
decidedly liberal, but then also without any firm footing
on Russian soil, and with only a weak connection with
the national spirit.

All the most remarkable men of Russia have this
dilemma to contend with. Minds like Pushkin, Gogol,
and Dostoyevski chose definitely to pursue the former
direction; those like Alexander Herzen and Iván
Turgenief, the latter.

<h2><small>VII.</small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> the year 1887, the hostility in Russia towards the
German Empire reached its height. They had the feeling 
that the future conflict was not very distant, and the
foreigner frequently heard expressions about the
impending European war. As a rule, these expressions
were desponding. There is nowhere such a lively
perception of the very great weakness of Russia as in
Russia itself. But what without qualification was
significant for Russia was the almost universal wish for
defeat. The foreigner heard this not only in Northern
but in Southern Russia, and it made no difference
whether the speakers were Russians from the east or
the west, provided only they were able men who loved
freedom. I have certainly heard the wish expressed, as
if by common consent, by more than fifty Russians, of
the most varied classes of society, and entirely
unacquainted with each other, that there should be a decisive
defeat in an ensuing war. We can scarcely imagine a
more instructive symptom than what I have here stated
of the deep despair which exists as to the present
condition of the country. No other possibility of liberation
from the predominant misery presents itself than that
which is offered in the weakness which an unsuccessful
war will entail on the ruling system.

It is not the first time that this sentiment has flourished
in Russia, and that wishes apparently so unpatriotic
have been cherished by men who have the greatest love
for their country, and are the best educated. It was the
case in the time of the Crimean War, and the wholesome
results which accompanied the defeat are distinctly
remembered.

The terrible oppression which exists at the present
time is by no means of so old a date as is sometimes
believed by those who think that Russia, as a matter of
course, is and constantly has been behind Europe. This
is a re-action toward the short but powerful and
remarkable period of freedom and emancipation in the first ten
years of the rule of Alexander II. On the whole, in
Russia freedom is the old, and oppression the
comparatively new. The oldest Russian law-book (<i>Pravda
Russkaya</i>) does not recognize corporal punishment.
Serfdom was first introduced in the sixteenth century,
and Pskof, the last free city, like the old Novgorod, a
republic governed by a popular assembly for centuries,
by the cruel order of the Muscovite Tsar, Vasíli, was
deprived of all its privileges, its inhabitants carried
away to the interior of Russia, “in order to live happily
by the grace of the Tsar,” and replaced by a newly
imported race of men. In the eighteenth century the
deliberative assemblies of the provinces, the Zemstvos,
which in the Middle Ages had spoken loudly and energetically, 
first lost all their importance, and the theory
of absolute power, on which the authority of the rulers
now rests in Russia, first took form in the nineteenth
century. It is not even of domestic origin.

Alexander I., in the first period of his reign,
manifested an almost modern spirit. He appeared to be a
man sincerely fond of freedom. He loved his age,
despised the proceedings of the revolutionary re-actionists,
was for a long time an admirer of Napoleon, continued
for a long time to wish well to France, and cherished
plans for the elevation of Poland. It seemed as if under
him the power of the Tsar, like everything else in
Europe, was to be humanized, and as if the voice of the
people would be heard. So, under the strong re-actionary
counter-shock towards the French revolution and empire,
it was two persons who were not Russians, the Piedmontese 
De Maistre and the Frenchman Bonald, who shaped
the great theory of re-action which was victorious
throughout Europe, which the <i>doctrinaires</i> of Russia
passionately appropriated, and which, easily manipulated by
them, became the new corner-stone of the Tsar’s throne.

The present condition in Russia is, then, neither the
result of a stagnation for a thousand years, nor of a
uniform progress towards the better, which has been too
slow and much delayed, nor of a retrograde movement
in culture uninterruptedly continued for a long time.
It is the product of a re-action now twenty-five years old,
constantly fortified anew by insurrections and attempts
at assassination.

It is not that there is a want of good will and
earnestness on the part of the Tsar. Justice is done
everywhere and in all circles to his character. It is known
that he likes to see honorable, upright men about him,
and also that he was angry at the corruption and deceit
which during the last Russo-Turkish war extended even
to the highest officers of the army, and had so large a
share in the unfavorable progress of the campaign. In
other words, it is admitted that he is a man of honor;
but a great man, a great leader, is at this moment
needed on the imperial throne of Russia. It is,
perhaps, a misfortune for a people to need great rulers.
A country like Holland or Switzerland certainly has no
need of any. But it is a greater misfortune not to have
a great ruler when one is needed.

The Tsar’s virtues as a private man are readily
recognized. For the first time for centuries, for the first time
probably at all, he furnishes an example of an occupant
of the throne of Russia, about whose relations to the
other sex even evil tongues have not the slightest thing
to report. The men, as well as the women, who have
occupied it, have for all time been renowned for their
erotic extravagances. The emperor seems to be a
pattern as a husband and a father. About this exemplary
imperial family, the Russian court nevertheless runs
riot with its elegant frivolity and its numberless
irregularities, without re-acting upon it, but also without being
influenced by the spirit which emanates from it. All
the world knows that the Prince Imperial Alexis lives
openly with the beautiful Countess de Beauharnais,
sister of General Skobelef, whose husband, a cousin of
the Prince Imperial, the Prince of Leuchtenberg, has
seen his profit in resigning his rights to a prince of the
imperial family. The beautiful German Princess Maria
Pávlovna, consort of Prince Imperial Vladimir, of whom
the author of the book <i>La Société de St. Petersbourg</i>,
instigated by his hatred to the Germans, relates all
imaginable evil, is, as it were, an incarnation of the
passion for court pleasures. It is not necessary to
believe what is said of her by the pen inspired by hate;
but this much is true, that there is a sort of recklessness
which stamps the tendency she gives to the amusements
of the court. She arranges parties in which they amuse
themselves with all kinds of games, but chiefly with
playing hide-and-seek (<i>cache-cache</i>). In such games now
and then a lady of the highest rank will be found
hidden away with an officer of the guards in an empty
bath-tub. One of the amusements of the youth in these
court circles, also, is to get up sleighing parties, in which
the finest ladies are taken out in basket sleighs drawn
by officers. The sport is that the officers at a certain
time upset the sleighs, with all their contents, in the
snow. They laugh at the result.

In certain higher circles of the court, where a different
spirit rules, there is no other amusement than dancing.
They dance continually, on all occasions, with a real
mania. They make up for their detention for many
months at Gátshina by whirling away in an endless
round dance. Where they do not dance, the tediousness
is overwhelming. Tea-parties in these upper circles are
described as tiresome. The guests arrive; after a while
the grand persons appear, and take their places in silence.
Evidently no one dares to ask so exalted ladies about
anything. Then from their side drops a question as to
the state of the health of one of the ladies present. As
a rule she answers briefly, and therewith the conversation 
dies away. If she is very ingenious or very
good-natured in relation to the embarrassment of the grand
company, she shapes her answer so that it makes a new
question almost necessary; but when the little series of
questions and answers having intimate connection with
this subject is exhausted, — as trustworthy eye-witnesses
assure me, — twenty or twenty-five minutes may elapse
in a pause of complete and painful silence, during
which the guests look smilingly on the exalted visitors,
who, in turn, distribute their smiles upon those about
them.

Even if there is a little more noise, the impression
may sometimes be not less painful. Eye-witnesses
have described the following scene: the old courtier,
Count A., fell while waltzing, and remained sitting
on the floor. This evoked a laugh from the Tsar.
Stimulated by having been the occasion of such a burst
of good humor on the part of one whom it had been the
study of the count’s life to please, the old man danced
out, and let himself fall again, this time with comic
gestures. Renewed laughter. From that the aged
courtier devoted himself the whole evening to evoking
smiles from the lips of the august being by playing the
clown. While all this was going on, his daughter, the
present Countess O., one of the ladies in waiting to the
empress, sat straight and stiff, with contented mien and
a smile in her eye, swallowing her anger at her father’s
abasement, and really satisfied with the obvious favor
which fell to his lot. The scene reminds one of what
is immortalized in the well-known painting of the
court of the Tsaritsa Anna Ivanovna, which is widely
known in Russia by the copper-plate engraving, and in
which the members of the first families of Russia are
represented playing leap-frog in the ball-room of the
palace for the amusement of their sovereign lady.

Court life was far from being so spiritless as now in
the time of Alexander II. The court bigotry, so closely
connected with shallowness, was also unknown during
his time. Now you find large circles among the
aristocracy who belong to the Radstock-Pashkof sect, which
was founded not many years ago by an impostor. In
these circles they pass their time in reading “The
Evangelists,” damn all who don’t think as they do, and, above
all, pick their neighbors to pieces. Fanaticism and a
malicious propensity to gossip generally go hand in
hand here. A large part of the members of this stratum
of society send their sick to the priest Joan in Cronstadt, 
whom they believe able to work miraculous cures
by the laying-on of hands. Even Loris Melikof sent a
daughter to him when she was ill.

The vigorous Greek-orthodox re-action in the highest
circles is comparatively new, and is now in full bloom.
It began under Alexander II. It was not that this
monarch was favorable to it; far from that. But his consort,
a German princess, at first from a desire for popularity,
afterwards from a want of an object in life, when
she felt that she had entirely glided out of the
existence of her volatile husband, took up the cause of
the Greek-orthodox Church with constantly increasing
warmth. Thus it happened for the first time from time
immemorial in this empire, where the clergy occupy an
inferior position and have little influence, that a priest
of the imperial household, the wise and fanatical
Bashanof, became influential at court. It was to this
man to whom it also happened to prepare the present
Tsaritsa, by instruction in the Greek religion, for her
change of confession. And among the court ladies
who were smitten with zeal for spreading abroad the
sound doctrine, and combating Roman Catholicism and
Lutheran Protestantism, especially when found within
the boundaries of the Russian Empire, Countess Antonie
Dmitrievna Bludova, a slightly deformed, energetic,
and intelligent girl, made herself very conspicuous. It
was she who, under Alexander II., cemented the union
between the Muscovite Slavophile party and Aksákof and
Katkóf, and was the first to master the Polish Marquis
Wielopolski’s plan for a reconciliation between Russia
and Poland, with a hostile attitude towards Germany.
Through her father, the well-known powerful minister,
she accomplished the appointment of Wielopolski as
governor in Poland; but then, after the revolt in 1863,
she was converted to the doctrine of the necessity of
the eradication of Roman Catholicism, and actually
initiated the horrible religious persecutions in Lithuania
and White Russia. It was she who stood at the head
of the idolizing of Vilna’s executioner, Muravief, in
St. Petersburg, after the attempts at revolt were drowned
in the blood of the Poles; and it was she who, on an
appeal to the liberal Prince Suvórof for a subscription
for the memorial present which was being procured for
the hero, at a public dinner received the courageous
answer, which deprived the prince of all popularity,
“If you will make the general a present of a gold axe,
my purse is at your service, countess.” She took care
that Katkóf’s most fanatical and bloodthirsty articles
were laid before the Tsar just at the moment when he
was in a receptive mood for that kind of reading; and
when, after Karakósof’s attempts at assassination in
1866, a decisive re-action took place, she contributed
perhaps more than any one else to bringing about the
result of placing the whole educational system in
bigoted hands, hostile to culture. From that time to
the present, this religious re-action has continued
uninterrupted, partly from fashion and partly as a prudential
precaution. The political re-action took it up in its
current, and carried it farther on.

This political re-action can be dated from 1863. An
orgy of ideas had preceded it, in which the whole nation
revelled in hopes of progress, and became intoxicated
with plans of emancipation.

The result of the Crimean War had put an end to the
system of the Tsar Nicholas. The time was passed
when fanatical narrowness and cruel harshness alone
ruled over everything in the Russian Empire. Not
only had the books and newspapers of Europe been
excluded, but the greatest obstacles had been put in
the way of travellers across the frontiers, whether going
or coming; nay, the hatred to the age had gone so far
in the first man of the empire, that he detested 
ways and prohibited their construction, so that Russia,
at his death, had only the single line between St.
Petersburg and Moscow, and this one was managed in such a
manner that the merchants preferred to send their goods
by the old teamsters, in common wagons, as the safer
and cheaper way.

The defeats in the Crimea brought the deliverance.
In however great respect for his father Alexander II.
had been educated, he was compelled at once on his
accession to the throne to repeal some of the most
absurd of these laws. This was received by the
people who had been so long gagged and fettered as if
from this time any kind of criticism of Nicholas’s
system of government would be allowed, and as if it was
the Tsar’s own intention now to change everything.
During the Crimean War, Herzen had already established 
his Russian printing-office in London; and his
weekly newspaper, <i>Kólokol</i> (The Bell), gave the
signal for the free and reckless inquiry into all the
blunders and follies of the old <i>régime</i>. Never had such
language been heard in Russia, never had any one
wielded such a pen. The boldness carried away the
readers and conquered all minds. Herzen was soon the
most influential man in Russia, the idolized dictator of
the intelligent youth. He seemed to be omniscient;
nothing which happened in the land, from which he
had been banished, escaped his attention, so thoroughly
was he informed. He published secret state papers,
like the memoirs of Catherine II.; he threw light upon
embezzlements, frauds, infamous and cruel deeds,
committed in various parts of the empire. He had so many
connections, and in such high places, that on a day
when <i>Kólokol</i> contained serious charges against one of
the imperial adjutants-general, and a number printed
in St. Petersburg, without the compromising passage,
was laid before Alexander, who was a constant reader
of the paper, a week or two later the Tsar received the
original number in an envelope, with a few lines which
gave the reason why it was sent in this manner. So
widely spread was his newspaper, that in Nizhni alone,
in 1859, one hundred thousand copies, which had been
introduced from Asia, were seized by the police.

There was at once formed a group of parties with
different shades of opposition or progress. There was
the opposition to the Germans flourishing at the court,
on the part of the higher nobility who had been set
aside by Nicholas in the interest of absolute power.
There was the opposition of the Slavophile, who, as
unaristocratic as possible, idolized the people. Finally,
there was Herzen’s, Ogaref’s, and, in a short time, the
sceptical, radical, and gradually socialistic opposition of
Bakunin, who had escaped from Siberia. And all these
groups of opposition, under these conditions, for the first
time in Russia created a press.

Until the forties there had not existed in the great
empire any other press than the official. Under
Nicholas the newspaper, “The Russian Bee,” an academical
organ, which was conducted in the spirit of the old
classical poets, Lomonósof and Derzhavin, carried on the
same war against the romantic tendency inaugurated
by Pushkin as Oginski’s organ in Warsaw had carried
on against Mickiewicz and his friends. It was the great
Kussian critic Byelinski who gained a hearing for the
national poetry of the nineteenth century. It was
under the control of the literary impressario,
Krayevski, who is still living, that the newspaper “The
Annals of our Fatherland” was published, and it was
sustained by the genial articles of Byelinski. When he
died, in 1847, worn out by his literary strife, by
poverty and disease, the Annals were continued in
<i>Sovremennik</i> (The Contemporary), to which journal the
poet Nyekrásof contributed, and which in 1858-62
was in the main inspired by Tchernuishevski, who, as
an author of novels and works on political economy, had
made a deep impression on his time.

But the importance of the press in Russia must be
dated from the end of the Crimean War, and from the
<i>début</i> of Herzen as a journalist. For before this time the
influence of the writers was extremely small, chiefly
because the more intelligent circles spoke and read only
French, with persistent contempt for the journalistic
productions in their mother tongue; besides, they were
compelled to limit their attention to purely literary
questions, especially such as this, whether the Russian
literature ought to be purely national or not.

Now, at the close of the sixth decade, hundreds and
hundreds of newspapers and periodicals were at once
established. How numerous they were is best shown
by a fact stated by Eckhardt, that in 1858-60 not less
than seventy-seven large newspapers were compelled to
suspend publication, without being perceptibly missed.
Then, as it still happens down to the present day,
the large monthly periodicals, each number as thick as a
good-sized book, began to give abstracts of books in the
natural sciences, literary history, or economy, to furnish
political comments, and to publish long society novels
of German, French, English, or native authors. The
legitimate daily newspapers, with genuine Slavic
enthusiasm, plunged into the most extreme radicalism. They
became, as it were, giddy from the heights which
European culture had attained, and to which the youth
of the capitals and the denizens of the provincial towns,
who had known nothing of the life of Western Europe,
were now suddenly carried.

The first question which forced itself upon the
thoughts of all was about the education of the people.
There were hardly any schools in the land, and the few
that did exist were, in the rural districts, wholly in the
hands of the ignorant popes. There were no other
teachers than the priests of the country towns. At
this time, Sunday schools were started, first in the
capitals, and then in various parts of the country, and the
teachers in these schools taught without pay, from pure
enthusiasm for the cause of the elevation of the people.
In the various divisions of the army, the officers taught
the recruits in similar schools, the officers of the Guard
distinguishing themselves as teachers above all others.

It was under these conditions that the great, far-reaching 
reforms which characterized the beginning of the
reign of Alexander II. were begun. The first of these
was that which, on the 19th of February, 1861, led to
the emancipation of the serfs, and gave to more than
fifty million of men personal freedom and a share in the
ownership of the soil of Russia. As a matter of course,
it caused a tremendous diminution of the power of the
noble landed proprietors. It was a measure at once
democratic and autocratic. And it was carried through
at a time when the powers that had hitherto been
respected had lost their splendor. The defeats in the
Crimea had destroyed the prestige of the army; the
shortcomings and the mistakes and the frauds of the
administration, which the war had brought to light, had given
a death-blow to official authority; the clergy had long
been utterly despicable. Now, by one blow the power
of the nobility was diminished in an unprecedented
manner, at the same time that a large part of their property
was taken from them without any proportionate
compensation. The hope that there would be a political
reform under Alexander II. was greatly weakened, just
because the social reform in this form came first. For a
long time, the enlightened classes had hoped for a 
“constitution,” — as it must naturally be in the beginning, an
aristocratic constitution. Now political liberalism stood,
in the presence of this gigantic advance of the power of
the Tsar, without any hope for the future. For now,
when all the lofty peaks of society were levelled, the
position of the power of the Tsar alone was unaffected
and even expanded to a dominion over soldiers and
peasants unlimited by any kind of barrier.

The great peasant population was still very far from
being satisfied. They had for a long time cherished
Utopian expectations, and now, especially since the
socialistic agitators had strengthened their illusions,
were waiting for the immediate transfer to them, then
and there, of all the land which they had cultivated,
without any equivalent. This disappointment brought
the peasants in the departments of Kazán and the Volga to
an armed insurrection. At the same time, disturbances
broke out among the students. The abnormal limitation
of the number of students at each of the universities to
three hundred had been repealed, and the scholar had
suddenly attained a prestige almost surpassing that
which the officers of the Guard had hitherto enjoyed.
Now, with a genuine Russian lack of principle, the
execution both of legal reforms and of a new plan of
education was intrusted to the old re-actionists. So far
as the former reform was concerned, the leading men,
like Count Panin, Minister of Justice, accommodated
themselves to the demands of the times; but only three
months later, when the emancipation of the serfs had
set all thought in vibration, a regulation for the
government of the universities was published, which deprived
the students of all the liberties previously given them,
and cut off their hopes of obtaining any of those which
they had been led to anticipate. They were deprived of
the liberty of holding meetings, forbidden to have charity
funds, and, in order to reduce their number, each
student was required to pay a fee of fifty silver rubles each
semester. In all the university cities, in Moscow as well
as in St. Petersburg, in Kief as well as in Kharkof, the
young men refused to submit to the new rules.
Conflicts with the police and the military followed.

In 1862 the irritation in Russia reached its height.
In various parts of St. Petersburg there was a series of
fearful conflagrations which indicated the breaking loose
of revolutionary instincts. The government interfered,
established a summary court for incendiaries, closed the
Sunday schools and other institutes and clubs, put
restraints upon the press, made the censorship more rigorous.

Thus when the baleful blindness of the Polish
demagogues and the indiscreet and cruel measures of the
noble Wielopolski against the dangerous spirit of
rebellion in Poland brought about the outbreak of the Polish
insurrection, it was the event from which all the re-actionary 
lusts and powers in Russia were to imbibe new force.

Up to this time, Alexander Herzen had been the hero
of cultured Russia. He had continually manifested a
lively sympathy for oppressed Poland, treated its cause
as his own and as that of his friends. He now
expressed himself warmly in behalf of the revolt, even
after the protecting attitude of the powers of the west
and their threatening mien towards Russia (which made
the Polish nobility, with Zamoiski at their head, conquer
their scruples against an alliance with the popular leaders
in Warsaw) had aroused and goaded the Russian national
feeling even among the liberal groups of the empire.

Then it was that Katkóf entered upon the scene, and
in the course of a very short time won all power out of
the hands of Herzen, and rose to the position of the
most influential man in Russia. This remarkable man,
who died only in August, 1887, represented during
twenty-five years the principle of oppression in a land
of oppression, promoted during the whole of that time,
with all his coarse energy, everything that was inimical
to liberty, wrote down everything that was non-Russian,
demanded and supported the establishment of complete
uniformity in the great empire.

Mikhail Nikoforovitch Katkóf is a unique phenomenon
in the history of Russia. As long as the empire has
stood, it has never been seen before his time that a
publicist, without official position and without any external
or official authority, has exerted an influence on the acts
of the government, saying nothing of what was the
case with him, exerting a greater influence than the
government itself. To that extent, but only to that extent,
can his life be said to point towards a new time.
Nevertheless the cause of satisfaction vanishes when we
examine into the manner in which he reached this degree
of power. He attained it because, with a recklessness
which too often disregarded the claims of truth and the
demands of justice, he devoted himself to flattering
the national vanity and cultivating the national pride in
its most detestable forms.

Katkóf made his <i>début</i> as professor of philosophy in
the University at Moscow with contributions of slight
importance to the history of philosophy. He was, from
the beginning, an adherent of German philosophy,
especially an admirer of Schelling, and then belonged to
the same circle as the enthusiastically satirical Byelinski
and the celebrated international revolutionist Bakunin.
He called himself an idealist and taught the cult of
the ideal. As a worshipper of the ideal in 1848 he was
removed from his position.

In 1856 he established a monthly periodical, “The
Russian Messenger” (<i>Russki Vyestnik</i>), and in 1861 he
assumed the control of the daily paper, “The Muskovite
News” (<i>Moskovskiya Vyedomosti</i>). He began his career
in both of the journals as an extreme liberal of the
English type, demanded self-government, extension of the
distribution of power, constitution, etc., until in 1861-2,
when radicalism broke out of bounds, when the disturbances 
of the peasants and of the students frightened
timid people, and when it was brought to light that a
multitude of men and women in high positions in Russia
were in communication with Herzen’s revolutionary
party in London, the possibility of a complete change in
public sentiment was apparent.

Then Katkóf felt that the moment was propitious for
a change of front and for setting himself up as the
<i>Savior of Russia</i>. He broke the silence which had
been laid upon the whole press of Russia in regard to
his old exiled friends, Herzen, Ogaref, and Bakunin.
Although their names could not be mentioned, and their
existence was officially ignored by the government, he
attacked them openly as enemies of their fatherland,
and to blame as the cause of all the disturbances. This
was the first shock given to the great influence of Herzen
among the cultured classes of Russia. And then in
1863, at the time when the Polish revolt broke out, when
Herzen committed the imprudence of offending the
Russian national feeling, and the approval with which
the uprising was greeted by the Russian emigrants had
the result that the liberal Russian newspapers manifested
their sympathy by silence, then it was that Katkóf made
his master-stroke. He denounced the emigrants and
nihilists as <i>perfidious traitors to their country</i>, preached
the strongest Russian <i>chauvinism</i>, demanded not only
that the rebels should be put out of the way, but that
the independent existence of Poland should be blotted
out by changing the kingdom to a Russian province.
When the revolt was quelled, Katkóf was one of the
most popular men in the higher circles of Russia. It
was he who caused Muravief to be sent as “Hanging
Dictator” to Wilna. It was under his ægis, under the
pretence of the law of self-preservation of the State,
that the democrats gave the Lithuanian peasants freedom
and land through the unbridled plundering of the Polish
nobility, and that the Slavophiles urged religious
persecution under the pretence of wishing to eradicate the
tyranny of the Catholic Church.

From this time on, Katkóf could only rise and rise in
influence in the same degree as the re-action in Russia
rose. He had identified himself with it.

The <i>quondam</i> philosopher was henceforth the most
zealous adherent of the Greek orthodoxy. The <i>quondam</i>
English liberal was henceforth a worshipper and
defender of the national absolutism, more national than
the government, more monarchical than his monarch.
All his disputes with the Court and the Tsar were only
<i>lovers’ quarrels</i>, occasioned by too much zeal on his part.

His power increased to an incredible degree. When,
on one occasion, the ministry forbade the publication of
his newspaper, he nevertheless issued it as usual, only
with the comment that it was forbidden, but that the
prohibition must have arisen from a misunderstanding.
It passed unchallenged; the Tsar sustained him.

The Polish nation, from this time forth, was to the
Slavophiles the embodiment of the detested Western
Europe and of the detested Catholicism. But the
ownership of the soil was given to the Lithuanian
peasants, chiefly because the Slavophiles, with Milyutin at
their head, hated the Poles as aristocrats. For them the
Polish nationality was a peculiarity of the noble caste,
and, as such, ought to be rooted out of Russia. Here
also the absolute power sought to contract an alliance
with the masses against the higher classes.

But to Katkóf personally the uniformity of the Russian
state was henceforward the most important principle. He
allied himself with the Slavophiles in order through their
worship of democracy to bring the government to stir
up the Finns against the Swedes in Finland, the
Lithuanians against the Poles in Poland, the Esthonians and
the Letts against the Germans in the Baltic provinces,
because they necessarily insisted on the idea that the
strengthening of all these oppressed small nationalities
in their relation to the ruling people was only the first
step to the final and complete Russianizing of those
countries.

Then in 1866 came the attempt of Karakósof to
assassinate Alexander II., and it gave to the re-action its last
strong impulse. Katkóf shouted with joy, “The pistol
shot of Karakosof has purified the air.”  It is quite true
that in a short time the government got frightened at
its alliance with democracy. It once more cast its
looks towards the nobles, whom it had hitherto
mistrusted, because they had wished for a constitution.
Even Katkóf’s paper was suppressed for two months, as
a punishment, because its editor had dared to publish a
warning from Valuyef. But soon the reign of terror,
friendly to the peasants, conquered under Milyutin in
Poland, and the example from Poland could not be
defied in Russia proper. The unrestricted, absolute
power and the unqualified Greek Catholic orthodoxy,
which had been upheld in the western provinces, were
necessarily upheld throughout the whole empire. Now,
when the glamour of the name of the Tsar has become
weaker, we can see the possibility, as a result of the
situation, that in times of disturbance a dictator might
usurp the power, — a man of revolution, for instance,
if such could be found, with a past and a popularity,
like Skobelef, the celebrated cavalry general who died
under such horrible circumstances.

From 1866 the current of re-action continually
increased. Everything helped it on, radical as well as
retrograde agitations in foreign lands. Soon at several
places in the empire the oppression becomes too strong,
produces this revolutionary propaganda or attempts at
political murder, and for every political prosecution
re-action takes a new stride, with doubled frenzy.
Everything strengthens it, everything works to its
advantage. The old “Nihilism,” which was described
by Turgenief, which was substantially an intellectual
emancipation, with its whole energy concentrated on
the attack on Christianity, and with a love for science,
which found its expression in dislike of art as useless
and undemocratic, was over about 1870. The insurrection 
of the commune in Paris, and the outbreaks of the
internationals, set the minds of the youth in active
ferment at this time. A generation had arisen, which,
instead of the individualized radicalism of the older
“Nihilists,” had socialism for a religion and <i>the people</i>
for a God.

From all parts of Russia and Siberia young girls
streamed to Zürich to study medicine and socialism. In
1872 Prince Krapotkin began to work among the artisans 
in the suburbs of St. Petersburg. In the beginning
of the seventies, young men and women of the families
of the highest rank, by hundreds and hundreds, “went
out among the people,” labored there twelve, fifteen
hours a day in the fields, in the workshops, in the
factories, in order to propagate modern ideas everywhere
among the common people. But in the provincial and
country towns, where everything is spread by rumor,
the presence of a propagandist could not possibly long
be a secret to the police and government. One arrest
followed another. Not less than thirty-seven provinces
were declared, in a government circular of 1875, to be
“infected by socialistic contagion.” In 1876 and 1877,
the whole of this generation, as it may be called, of
youth with their minds in a ferment was mowed down.
All the prisons were full of political offenders, and it
was constantly found necessary to build new ones.
Mere suspicion led to imprisonment. A letter from a
friend who had “gone out among the people,” an answer
from a child twelve years old, who, when interrogated
by the police, did not know what he said from fright,
was quite sufficient. So also in 1876 to 1878, in the
different Russian cities, on the chance occasion of a
funeral or a death sentence, there were demonstrations
and street revolts, the outbreak of passionate despair,
meaningless in so far as they could never reach the
proportions of a general revolt, and invariably
immediately suppressed by the military. The uselessness of
all such demonstrations produced the result that a party
of terror was finally formed, which determined to work
by single attempts at assassination.

The earlier propaganda made its exit at the end of
the seventies with the 193 trial. These unfortunate 
persons had been in prison for four years, while the slow
and thorough investigation lasted. The Russian cell
system during this period bore so heavily upon them,
that of the one hundred and ninety-three no less than
seventy-five committed suicide, became insane or died.
A special tribunal had been arranged for the trial of
this cause, so that it was not to be expected that the
judgment would be against the government. There were
sentences of ten, twelve, fifteen years imprisonment, with
hard labor, for two or three lectures, privately delivered
to a handful of workmen, or for having bought or loaned
a single book. And so harshly were political prisoners
treated in prison that in the central prison at Kharkof
(“house of terror”) there were several attempts at
insurrection among them for the purpose of obtaining the
same treatment as the common criminals. And when
the senate of Alexander II., which in other respects was
pliant enough, in the form of a petition for pardon,
acquitted the larger number of the 193, the Tsar
personally set aside the verdict of the Senate. Not even in
the laws which this government had promulgated did
it seek its support against its antagonists. It was,
therefore, natural that these antagonists did not regard
it as anything else than organized injustice, against
which all weapons seemed to be allowable.

In 1877 followed Viera Sassúlitch’s attempt to
assassinate General Trepof, who had caused a political
prisoner to be whipped, and her acquittal by the jury,
which aroused the attention of the whole of Europe.
In August, 1878, came the bullet from “Stepniak’s”
revolver, which, in the forenoon, in the open street, killed
General Mesentzef, chief of the political police.<footnote>Stepniak: <i>Underground Russia</i>. Introduction.</footnote> Among
the numerous attempts at political murders which now

followed are the four against Tsar Alexander II., of
which the first occurred April 2, 1879, the last, which
resulted in his death, March 13, 1881.

Nothing has set Russia farther backward than this last
occurrence, which was pregnant with misfortune. It
immediately prevented the formation of a sort of
parliamentary constitution, which had just then been
promised. It frightened the successor to the crown back
from the paths his father had entered upon at the
beginning of his reign, and it seemed to justify the rulers in
reprisals and measures of prevention of every kind.

Thus they have reached a point where they now are,
reached a policy which is no policy, — a policy of
apprehension and irresolution.

Generally, when we speak of the policy of Russia, we
mean its foreign policy, and many are dazzled by the
extraordinarily large display of the power of the empire.
We speak about Russia’s great “mission” in Central
Asia, about its irresistible advance towards India, etc.,
and then we admire Russian statesmanship. But what
power is there in Russia’s subjugating a little larger
or smaller number of semi-barbarian tribes in Asia,
and what statesmanship is there in involving itself
continually with more wars there, when it must
concern Russia to collect all its powers and make all its
preparations for the great impending conflict! These
Russian generals, with their victories won from Tatars
and Turcomans, remind us altogether too much of those
French commanders who were victorious over Abd-el-Kader 
and were defeated by Moltke. What else are
they doing in Russia now, than once a year to conquer
an Abd-el-Kader!

And to pit against a man with Bismarck’s genius for
managing foreign affairs, Russia has not a single prime
minister, not one of any kind whatever. For there is no
prime minister in the Russian ministry. The unlimited
power of the Tsar does not tolerate this at all. When
Gortchakof was chancellor it was only a title. Under the
present management, Russia, the great exponent of the
Slavs, has succeeded in making itself detested to the
uttermost by all the Slavic nations. This government has
carried it to so great an extent that Russia is now hated
by Bulgaria and Servia (nay, by the common people of
Roumania) as it is hated by the Poles, — and that means
much. Russia liberated Bulgaria from the Turkish reign
of terror, and has now successfully, after the lapse of
not ten years, by falsehood, violence, hypocrisy, by
infamous acts for whose authority the Bulgarians looked
to the higher circles of the Russian government, brought
matters to the pass that the liberators of that day
are more hated than the oppressors were ten years
ago.

But the internal policy is still more pitiable. It is
certainly not a parliament which is most greatly needed.
Only the naive youth in Russia can think that. A
parliament could easily be imagined so chosen that it would
be more conservative than the government itself. It
would, in all probability, if established now, be such a
body as the <i>Duma</i> (city council) in Moscow is. That
is elected. Yes; Moscow has what Paris has so long
fought for in vain, — its own elected mayor. The <i>Duma</i>
is not on that account the less conservative, and it would
not present a different appearance if it had been the
government and not the citizens in Moscow who had elected
its members. No, it is not a popular assembly that it
concerns Russia to get first. Russia needs a <i>bonâ fide</i>
administration. Yet it is understood everywhere there
are no institutions, no provincial home rule, no 
independent courts, no genuine seminaries of learning, no
schools in the proper sense.

During the whole of the reign of this Tsar the
enormous Siberia has been denied the permission to found
even a single university. It was feared that it would
give Asiatic Russia too much independence. Permission 
has only just been given for the foundation of a
university at Tomsk, which, in the present circumstances,
is of hardly any importance.

All knowledge is dreaded. The most recent circular
(illegal, but carried into effect), which after Katkóf’s
death was prepared by the curator in Odessa, makes it
the duty of the school committees to decide whether the
parents are sufficiently well off for the children to be
admitted to a grammar school. They are required to
ask how the parents live, in what kind of a house and
of how many rooms, how much money they earn annually,
and who their friends are.

The universities are closed at the least sign of a
disturbance. This happened to all the universities in Russia
proper in the spring of 1888, after the unimportant affair
of Brysgalof’s box on the ear at Moscow; St. Petersburg,
Moscow, Kazan, Kharkof, and Odessa were at once closed
for fear of students’ pranks.

Since then the curator of the universities in Odessa
has prepared a new circular, in which it is said: “Since
several instructors have allowed themselves publicly to
express their thoughts without the reservations which
are due to their position in the educational system, and
without feeling themselves bound by the duties of the
service when the question turned upon something which
had no direct connection with this service, — and since
they have even appeared as recognized organs for
certain circles of society, have taken part in party debates,
nay, have even allowed themselves to be drawn into
controversies in newspapers, — the curator requires them
for the future to use greater prudence.”

It forbids them to take part in the discussion of social
and literary questions. It closes with the expression of
the hope that for the future they will solemnly devote
their leisure hours to matters of instruction and
education.

All this was because a poor little teacher in a club
had suffered himself to criticise Katkóf.

Upon the whole, we in Western Europe can form no
idea of the grade of civilization occupied by these
curators. When, in 1884, the students in Kief had arranged
a banquet on the jubilee of the old university, one fine
day, by a gratuitous regulation of the curator, they were
wholly excluded from participation in the festival.
When they, mortified and exasperated as they were,
hissed at the curator and the well known president of
the Synod Pobyedonostsef, as a punishment they were
<i>all</i> expelled from the university. There was only one
single man in Russia with whose principles it agreed to
praise this act: it was Katkóf. The students, he wrote,
who had not participated in the demonstration are
responsible for not having prevented it.

From absolutely trustworthy sources there has been
communicated to me the following incident, which
recently occurred in the case of another curator, Novikof,
who had come to examine (audit, as it is called) a school
in Novgorod. He finds at the teacher’s two books: one,
a collection of Korolenko’s tales; the other, a volume of
Dostoyevski’s. Not having any idea as to who the first
author is, he looks for the name of the publisher and finds
the name of the magazine <i>Russakaya Mysl</i> (The
Russian Thought), which is published in Moscow and edited
by Goltzef in a moderate, liberal spirit. He says, in
a discontented tone, “Don’t read productions from the
socialist organ! But,” he continues, “what dissatisfies
me still more, is that you have Dostoyevski here.
He talks about love too much in his books. I know,
indeed, that it is the Christian love; but it doesn’t
matter, it is love all the same, and love is good enough
in the beginning, — but look out how it ends!”

Now, if we distinctly conceive what authority such a
curator of universities possesses, especially those who
rule over the universities at the capitals, we shall not
be greatly surprised at the monstrosities in instruction
to which the press now and then dares to call
attention. Recently the <i>Vyestnik Yevropi</i> thus called
attention to the oddity of some lectures on psychology
which this spring seriously occupied the good society in
St. Petersburg. Vladislavlef, a professor of Philosophy,
gave an outline of psychology, which contained the
following analysis of the sentiment of respect: “This
sentiment,” he said, “increases or diminishes in proportion
to the income of its object. A man who has three
thousand rubles a year necessarily has a great respect for a
man who has fifteen thousand. And a man who, for
example, has over seven million rubles a year (in this
he seems to allude to the Tsar) necessarily makes the
impression of a colossal greatness. On the other hand,
poverty engenders indifference or disdain.” He said all
this without irony, and also not even citing many
instances of the fact, but as the expression of a
psychical law.

Where such a management and such instruction are
possible, it must be self-evident that the acquisition of
the higher education is rendered difficult for the young
men. So far as the young women are concerned, the
conditions are even more unfavorable. Although it has
been constantly forbidden them to attend the universities 
of Russia, to say nothing of passing examinations
and taking degrees, still no young women in Europe
crave a scientific education like those of Russia. About
ten years ago, some liberal professors in St. Petersburg
and others in Moscow, under the leadership of Professor
Guerrier, established a kind of university for women in
each city. The professors of the universities and men
eminent for their literary culture (like Vesselovski and
Storosyenko) gave their time without pay, and young
girls from seventeen to twenty and upwards came in
crowds to hear good lectures on science, mathematics,
history, literature, and some other branches. As a
matter of course, these lectures were neutral in politics.
For some time, a dislike for this course had been
manifested on the part of the Tsar. For when the Tsaritsa
was asked to allow them to ornament the diplomas not
only with medallion portraits of the Tsaritsas Catherine
and Elizabeth, but also with hers, permission was
refused, so that it was necessary to put the date in the
space which was reserved for the portrait of the
Tsaritsa Maria Feodorovna. A year ago last spring the
universities for women received a blow in a communication
stating that they would be closed from and after the
month of June, 1887, and that all instruction of that kind
would be suspended. The expression that he wished to
send all the Russian women back home is, in Russia,
generally attributed to a person occupying a very high position.

This is the condition in which the most intelligent
part of the youth grow up.

It was from feeling that in such conditions all exertion 
to attain a higher position must fail, that Gárshin
has a novel with the following argument.

A palm, which has been brought from its tropical
home to a conservatory in St. Petersburg, struggles
towards the clear sky and burning sun of its native
land. It grows on in the hope of bursting through the
glass roof of the conservatory and gaining its freedom.
Finally, the wished-for moment comes. The panes in
the roof yield to the pressure of its branches, the
curled-down plant stretches itself out into the clear air
of the open day. Then it meets the cold wind and the
damp snow. It is frozen through, its crown withers
away, and the owner of the conservatory has the tree
cut down.

<h2>VIII.</h2>

“<sc>The</sc> Russian press! I am provoked at this
everlasting talk about the Russian press,” broke out the
editor of the Russian paper having the widest
circulation. “There is simply no press in Russia. There are
printing-presses and paper, of course, and black marks
on a white surface; there are editors and journalists, but
a press is not and cannot be found.”

From the nature of the case, the Russian press cannot
have any political importance, entirely without regard to
the question whether, like the newspapers in the departments 
and some periodicals in the capitals, it has to pass
under the supervision of the censor or not.

The best known newspaper, in a foreign language, is
a French official journal (the <i>Journal de St. Petersbourg</i>); 
next the two larger German papers in St.
Petersburg (St. Petersburg <i>Zeitung</i> and the “St.
Petersburg Herald”); and a small German sheet in Moscow
(the Moscow <i>Zeitung</i>), the last being extremely
moderate, and at every opportunity only defends and
demonstrates the excellent, admirable relations which prevail
between Germany and Russia. Besides the official
government paper, and a little sheet written in a light
and entertaining, and sometimes rather frivolous style,
but which has a very large circulation, there are in
St. Petersburg two newspapers which are generally
read: <i>Nóvosti</i> (News), a so-called liberal paper,
dignified in its tone, edited by Notóvitch, whose best 

assistant, in directions which are not political, is the poet
P. Weinberg, the well known translator of Heine.
Since the publisher is of Jewish extraction, this paper
is continually taxed with serving the interests of the
Jews. It is sober, serious, earnest, supports the cause
of European culture, but is not on that account the less
patriotic in its attitude toward England and Germany.

With this paper the <i>Novoye Vreviya</i> (the New Times)
lives in constant controversy. It is a well written
journal, but entirely without principle, edited after the
pattern of the French <i>Figaro</i> (especially as this
newspaper was edited in earlier times), by Suvórin, a literary
man of business, who in his day made himself renowned
in Russia by his open declaration that the time had
now come when literature ought to step down from its
pedestal, and understand that it is a commodity like
other wares, subject to the same laws of supply and
demand as everything else, and that there is no disgrace
in it. In obedience to this view, <i>Novoye Vremya</i> drifts
with the wind; in the shortest time possible attacks and
defends the same cause and the same person, generally
in incisive, entertaining articles. The newspaper is
more read than respected. It is known that it is
without faith and law (<i>sans foi ni loi</i>). From its nature it
cannot occupy a leading position, and its political
influence is absolutely <i>nil</i>.

Since Suvórin, besides his newspaper, has a great
publishing house in Moscow, his literary influence is
necessarily not unimportant. Many young liberal authors, for
the sake of the honorarium, exhibit the weakness of
putting their articles or novels into his widely circulated
sheet, however little they may sympathize with its
standpoint. Suvórin spares no expense in advertising;
and, as he has agents in all the large cities, Europe is
constantly kept informed through the telegraph bureau
of what the <i>Novoye Vremya</i> has said about this or that,
— a thing in and for itself as unimportant as the barking
of a dog or the soughing of the wind in the streets of St.
Petersburg, but which at a distance is regarded as an
affair of some weight. The <i>feuilleton</i> of this sheet is
edited by a certain Burénin, who is entirely worthy of
his master. The other coadjutors take the tone which
is given them by Suvórin and by him.

About one of them, B——of, a foreign author, who
had delivered a course of lectures in St. Petersburg,
related the following veritable anecdote: “B——of
wrote to me several times, while I was still at home,
sent me a book, and ended with placing himself and the
<i>Novoye Vremya</i> at my disposal on the occasion of my
visit to St. Petersburg. Immediately after my arrival
he called on me, invited me to his house, with so much
zeal that he assured me that a plate was ready for me at
his table every day. He gave a very favorable report of
my first lecture, after having requested the use of my
notes in the preparation of his article. Several times
he expressed the wish that I would take his wife with
me on a shopping expedition. His manner was so insinuating 
as to affect me not quite agreeably. I held a little
back; and when, at last, after a renewed invitation, I
indicated that it would be impossible for me on that day
to make any purchases in company with his wife, he
inserted in his paper the same evening, without any
reference to the preceding articles, the boldest attack
upon me. ‘He had long kept silent, and watched,’ said
the article, ‘but at last so great a lack of talent and
conceit must be punished;’ nay, concealing the fact,
known to him, that I had received one of my lectures
back from the censor, so that I was obliged to substitute
another, unknown in Russia, but previously delivered,
he charged me principally with not being able to hit
upon anything new, but with confining myself to the
presentation of old and well known stories. 'The
Russian public,’ it added, ‘was not so stupid as I
supposed, nor yet so ignorant. It is understood very well
that in such circumstances the stranger treats it like
a fool in order to get his fingers into its pockets.’” My
informant adds, “Even with abundant experience from
the press of other lands, even with all the surprises of
the past which no one who lives the literary life
escapes, the foreigner will be surprised at the shamelessness 
and corruption, not so much of some Russian as of
some particular St. Petersburg newspapers.”

Moscow, like St. Petersburg, has two large newspapers. 
One is liberal, written in the best style, and
the most honorable of all the Russian newspapers,
<i>Russkiya Vyedomosti</i> (The Russian Times), published by
Sobolevski, a quiet, honorable, energetic, and scientific
man, formerly a professor, but now an editor. This
daily paper, certainly the most widely circulated in
Russia, has 30,000 subscribers. Next to this is the
newspaper hitherto better known in Western Europe, the
<i>Moskovskiya Vyedomosti</i>, the organ of the lately
deceased Katkóf.

Katkóf was a man without much knowledge and of
little reading. In the last twenty years of his life he
never read a single book. There was no need of his
reading or thinking to support and maintain the general
Russification. But he wrote exceedingly well; he was
of the first rank among the prose authors. His paper
did not have many subscribers; not a third part of what
the <i>Russkiya Vyedomosti</i> has. But it was written for
a single reader, who never skipped a single number,
his Majesty the Tsar Alexander III. And voluntary
subscribers were not wanting when it was supported by
the order of the government. All the institutions and
foundations of the Crown, the schools, courts, etc., were
bound to support this sheet.

When Katkóf died, and the state of his fortune came
to light, his name lost a large share of its glamour. He
left an astonishingly large fortune, so large that it could
not be explained except by gifts from the rich merchants
of Moscow. Katkóf had indeed met their views by
opposing all reduction of the tariff. It also made a
disagreeable impression on the Tsar that he, by an evasion
of the law, by a transfer of his property in his lifetime,
cheated the State of the succession tax in addition.

Besides the <i>Moskovskiya Vyedomosti</i>, which still
exists but has lost all importance, there has just been
started another newspaper in a similar spirit. The
weekly newspaper <i>Grazhdanin</i> (The Citizen) has
become a daily, and, according to report, the government
will grant it a large annual subsidy. It is to be edited
by the well known author of poor novels, Prince Meshcherski, 
a re-actionist and tale-bearer, is to have the
same drift as Katkóf’s paper, only with out-and-out
servility instead of talent.

The more important monthlies play a greater part
than in any other land, for the rules of the censorship
allow much to appear in a periodical that would be
forbidden in a book form. Nevertheless in the last ten
years several of the best Russian reviews, like the
<i>Dyelo</i>, for example, have been suppressed. Every month
there appears a number of each of the large periodicals,
as thick as two numbers of the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>
together.

The best known is <i>Vyestnik Yevropi</i> (The European
Messenger), edited by Stassulevitch, a stately and finely
cultivated man about sixty years old, formerly a
university teacher, now occupied with economical and hygienic
questions, such as the improvement of the river water
in St. Petersburg. His periodical is the organ of correct
liberalism. It has a circulation of 7,000. The two great
authors, now old men, Gontcharóf and Arsénief,
contribute to this magazine, the former at the present time
publishing his life, and the latter a clever, scientific
critic, affable towards the younger generation. It relies
on a circle of men among whom the literary historians
Pypin and Spasovitch are well known. The latter has
already been spoken of. The former, who originally
belonged to Tchernuishevski’s group and passed for a
radical, but escaped accusation, as author of the great
work, “The History of the Slavic Literature,” in which
the pressure laid on by the censor is felt all the way
through, has presented a profound and real representation 
of the intellectual struggle for existence, and
literary productions of the different Slavic races.
Unfortunately the most important part, the history of the
literature of Great Russia, is still wanting. The two
eminent advocates and publicists Koni and Utin are
also coadjutors of the <i>Vyestnik Yevropi</i>. The former
is best known as an author by his interesting
treatment of “Dostoyevski as an analyst of crime;” the
other, by the series of articles published in the periodical
under the title “From Bulgaria,” which was forbidden
publication in book form by the censor.

By the side of this great St. Petersburg review stands
Goltzef’s Moscow periodical, <i>Russkaya Mysl</i> (The
Russian Thought), as suggested above, conducted in the
same spirit as <i>Russkiya Vyedomosti</i>, and supported by
the contributors to that daily paper. It has 10,000
subscribers.

Finally there is the <i>Severni Vyestnik</i> (The Northern
Messenger), with 4,800 subscribers, published by a lady,
Miss Evreïnova, hitherto the most sprightly and most
modern of these periodicals, but which has now met
with a very great loss, because the celebrated and
influential critic Mikhaïlovski has separated from it, and may
possibly carry a staff of sympathizers with him. This
periodical, on account of the advanced views of several
of the contributors, is suspected by the government and
placed under the censor. Miss Evreïnova is a lady in
the forties, with a stern face and gray hair. She has
spent several years on the shores of the Adriatic near
Montenegro, in the study of the old Slavic conditions,
has copied and published manuscripts written in old
Slavic. Having used up her property in this work, she
assumed the publication of <i>Severni Vyestnik</i> as a means
of subsistence. She is a Russian slave to duty, with a
good but not discriminating intellect.

Her circle of contributors has hitherto chiefly
consisted of bright literary Bohemians, who in Russia are
utterly poor, hungry, and in debt, the older among them
generally unhappily married. They live exclusively
with each other in a world by themselves, — sadly
enough, almost without exception, addicted to drink, and
utterly wanting in nervous equipoise on account of their
many years of misery and exile. Among them there are
still several eminent authors, who have succeeded in
passing through the anxieties of a literary life and of
exile with unimpaired bodily and mental health.

There was Pratopopof, who long ago contributed to the
“Annals of our Fatherland,” with great talent and
spirit. Then he was exiled, and is now back again.
There is Korolenko, who, broad-shouldered and boyish,
has returned from Yakutsk. There was Gárshin, who,
though subject to repeated attacks of insanity, has
published fine and vigorous novels. He was greatly under
the influence of Tolstoï, but nevertheless has his own
stamp of desperate pessimism. There was the leader
<i>Mikhailovski</i> himself, in his style inclined to the
imitation of the satirical tone of Saltykof, as a critic audacious
and wily, who is capable of placing a not inconsiderable
store of learning and remarkable ingenuity at the service
of the opposition. There is Zlatovratski, who describes
almost ideal peasants, and, himself resembling a poor
workman of the peasant rank, poor as Job, with a great
flock of children, and such a slave to alcohol that he does
not any longer dare to go out in the streets alone.
Finally there is Glyeb Uspyenski, a great and shining
talent, far more important than his brother, Nikolaï
Uspyenski, whose <i>Viesna</i> was translated into Danish
by Thor Lange. In Glyeb, who is familiarly called by
his first name, the advanced youth see their apostle.
Unfortunately he too has fallen so low as to spend six
or seven hours on a stretch in the dram-shops of St.
Petersburg, but his abilities have not been impaired by
his irregular life outside of the pale of society. His
works, consisting of nothing but short stories, already fill
a long row of volumes. At the present time he presents
in novels and articles only the woman of the working
class, and he works over and elucidates the idea, which
haunts him, that this woman has no right to be a mother,
since she cannot support her child. He pictures the
loose morals of factory life, and the unmerited disgrace
which falls upon the woman who errs; but he also
writes <i>for</i> the working-women, with the design of
impressing upon them that they, for the sake of the
children, ought not to become mothers.

Glyeb Uspyenski is the genuine literary gypsy. He
borrows and gets along without troubling himself about
money. He cannot see a needy person without giving
him all the money he has with him, and often more;
for he borrows of one to give to another. The admiration 
which is given him in wide circles prevents any one
being angry with him for any irregularity. He is
forgiven with the words, “We must remember it is
Glyeb.”

Apart from a few of the most eminent of these authors,
it may be said that what is common to all these younger
and older authors is propensity to drink, laxity in money
matters, lack of fundamental culture, and an every-day
dull melancholy. Several of them are utterly ruined by
the homeless life, with its debauches of ale, champagne,
and women. The loss of all illusions as to the attainment 
of freedom and happiness, the feeling of boundless
disappointment in life, and of a lack of means to do
anything for the people or the country, brings them to
despair, and to seek to forget the despair in a life of
stupefaction.

It is clear that these writers know only a very small
part of society, and possess only a restricted and peculiar
intellectual culture. And as they have no acquaintance
with the higher classes of society, from which they
suspiciously keep aloof, so these classes have no
acquaintance with them. Towards society in St. Petersburg
they occupy the position of pariahs. At best their works
only are known. The authors as persons have no
existence for the fine gentlemen and ladies.

Even the oldest and greatest of them live entirely
secluded, and almost every one of them has a wife, who
does not understand him at all, and with whom it is
only with difficulty that he continues to live; yet the
author makes all sorts of concessions from his good
nature. When a near friend one day said to one of the
most important, an old man, “How can a stupid woman
get such a control over a man?” he answered, “<i>Only</i> a
stupid woman. A man who has something to do has no
weapons against stupidity, which tires, nags, always
begins over, and never knows when it is beaten. An
amiable and intellectual woman would never gain such
an influence over her husband.”

The old <i>Saltykof</i> (Shchedrin), the satirist, the most
popular author of liberal Russia, at the present time is
lying ill of the gout, and it is hardly likely that he will
recover. In the eyes of those who value the tendencies
in their poetical works more than that which is essentially 
poetical therein, he is a greater author than Tolstoï.
Of all the authors now living, he is certainly the one
who has most consistently made use of irony as the
style of prose writing. In his whole form he is the
unconscious product of the circumstances. With a
passion like his for justice and for civil freedom on the one
side, and the government on the other, all criticism of
the situation must necessarily assume the character of
pleasantry. But what pleasantry! Read as an illustration 
his book, “Our Pompadours.”

By a remarkable change in the meaning of the word,
they mean in the daily speech in Russia by the word
Pompadour, a man who governs by the aid of the rule
of his mistress. In Saltykof’s work provincial governors
of this kind are characterized by the dozen.

As an idea of his method of representation, take this
fragment of a dialogue: The clerk is met in the morning 
at the office by his superior, an official under the
governor, with the exclamation, “Do you know that our
fellow has been dismissed?” — “Of whom does your
Excellency condescend to speak to me?” — “Of whom?
Of our little Pompadour, naturally.” — “At this answer,”
relates the clerk, “my heart stood still in my breast.
Little by little, it began to beat again; I thought that
we should not be left without a head.” — “Does your
Excellency know who has been named as his successor?”
— “A certain Udarin.” — “A general?” — “Yes, a
general.”<footnote>In Russia, there are civil as well as military generals, and just as
many of them.</footnote> — “Of what kind, if I may ask?” — “A
mammal.” — “We were both thoughtful,” continues the clerk.
“Then I went out into the market, and told the news to
some muzhiks who stood there. ‘Do you know that his
Excellency Aufimof is no longer our governor?’ — ‘Bah,
what of it!’ The peasant had scarcely uttered these
words before my hand had given a sound whack on his
cheek. ‘But a new one is coming! a new one is
coming!’ bellowed the peasant. I continued to strike — I
heard it not. At last, it fell like dew upon my soul: ‘A
new one is coming.’ That was the consolation. I gave
the peasant ten kopeks.”

Another sketch describes how the clerk one fine morning, 
when the newly installed governor gives a free rein
to his ideas and dreams about his coming administration, 
allows himself the remark that the law sets certain
bounds to these fantasies; as, for instance, as to
whipping. There are cases where the law declares it to be
useful, and others in which it is forbidden. “You will
then have the goodness to inform me when, and when
not,” said the governor, ironically. — “Not I, your
Highness, but the law.” — “That is becoming interesting.”
The governor, it appears further, had long known that
there were laws, but he always conceived them as bound
books arranged in a case. It was for him the order, —
lawful order. When he, on the other hand, saw these
same books lying about among others on a table in a
room, that was disorder. But what he did not know was
that these same laws allowed him certain acts and
forbade him others. He regarded them simply as a hymn,
composed in the interests of the small pompadours, for
their honor, to serve them for recreation. Since he was
modest by nature, and blushed whenever he heard any
one echo his praises, it can be understood that he did
not care to fumble in the laws. When it now dawned
upon the governor that the law forbids him to sentence
the bigwig Proshorof, whom he was burning to let feel
his wrath, to a good sound whipping, he became very
uneasy. It soothed him very little that, according to the
clerk’s disclosure, he always had the recourse of having
him flogged secretly and without witnesses. And now
his state of mind at this discovery is portrayed. “He
had never yet felt such an annoyance. It seemed to him
as if he had fallen into a danger, and as if he heard an
inward challenge not to be a coward, but to show
personal courage.” And he shouted with the voice of a
commander: “Let Proshorof be flogged on the spot —
publicly.”

A favorite subject for Shchedrin’s satire is the system
of patronage, which flourishes in Russia as nowhere else.
Every kind of patronage is possible here, if you have
connections among the superior officers. A St. Petersburg 
family of my acquaintance, who were going down
to Southern Russia, had a whole railway carriage sent
up from Orel, and travelled in it from St. Petersburg
down to the door of their country house. It even
happened to me that one night on the railroad at Smolénsk
a separate carriage, with a bed ready for use, was placed
at my disposal by the station-master, who had received
an order to that effect from his superior, while the 
occupants, in spite of my protest, were turned out and placed
elsewhere. “You need not say anything against it,” said
the station-master to me. “You may be sure that there is
not one of them who has paid for his ticket.” I inquired
of some of the bystanders, and it appeared that such
was the fact. Thus, on this occasion, the higher patronage 
did not violate other privileges than those which
were acquired by the exercise of inferior authority.
Another favorite subject for attack with Shchedrin is the
system of bribery, which flourishes in consequence of
the low intellectual standpoint and poor pay of the
officials. That these men are stupid and servile is chiefly
because, as a rule, they must rise in the service from the
lower ranks. They are frequently invalids when they
approach towards power and influence. As the phrase
goes, “My uncle, the general, had a fit of apoplexy, so
he became a senator; he lost his sight, and then he wras
made a member of the council of the empire. If he can
only have a new accident he will die as minister.” Bribery 
naturally has its root in the fact that the salaries are
so low. They regard the drink money which is given to
the officials about as we do the honorarium which is
given to the clergy, although the latter also have their
salaries from the State. The worst of it is that the
relation of the officials to the treasury of the State is often
so untrustworthy. From that comes the Russian proverb, 
“All steal, except Christ,” with the blasphemous
addition, “and he would if his hands were not nailed to
the cross.” Or this proverb, “If you are going to talk
to an official, you must talk rubles to him.” All these
customs have one good side, that the officials, just because
of their lax morals, sell the common people an otherwise
unattainable freedom: tolerance, impunity for the innocent, 
and free passage for men and books. But it will
be understood that this circumstance does not make the
government any more worthy of respect.

An administration like this naturally invites a
satirical, humorous treatment like Shchedrin’s. If you
compare his satire with that of a Polish author of the same
period, like Svientochovski, you will find that, while the
satire of the Pole is almost always anti-clerical, and is
weakened in its effects upon the masses by the appearance 
of anything unpatriotic, yet in this direction the
Russian satire has its sting unsheathed and its spear-head
tempered and glowing like that which was plunged into
the eye of Cyclops by Odysseus.

The most important of the contributors to the newspapers 
and periodicals have now been mentioned. Next
comes a whole long list of authors, historical, critical,
philosophical, and anthropological, — whose learning is
irreproachable, whose style is a trifle professorial, and
who as a rule lack inspiration.

Among the historians, jurists, and critics who have
already been mentioned, as well as outside of these
circles, the foreigner meets many who at first make this
impression upon him: They remind him of the German
scholars, particularly as they were a generation ago.
They have solidity, earnestness, and a little heaviness.
A Russian philologian is, indeed, only exceptionally
(like Korsh, in Moscow) crammed with learning like a
German, but to compensate for this these scholars are
usually able to clothe their thoughts in a much more
available form. They do not have the boyish innocence,
which at seventy unites red cheeks and light blue eyes,
as I have seen in the old German philologian Fleischer.
But they do have — especially the Little Russians —
breadth, good nature, which smiles in great dimples on a
brown cheek, roguishness, as a clever woman is roguish.
They are impregnated with the modesty of genuine and
refined culture. While the German, whether he has a
better or poorer opinion of himself, always — and with
a certain degree of right — acts upon the theory of the
conceded superiority of German science, the Russian
often places the information and knowledge of the
foreigner above his own. The more he knows, the less
contented he is in general with the development of science
in Russia.

Among the scientists and authors in Russia there are
men of great originality, men whose whole being shows
how much originality is suppressed by the Russian rule.
Such a man is the naturalist Mikluho-Maklay.

He is not only a distinguished anthropologist, but
king of the Australasian island which bears his name.
He came back to St. Petersburg with his wife, an
Englishwoman from Sidney, to publish a great work. As
king he had the right on his island to have one hundred
and forty-seven native wives, but, according to his own
account, he has not availed himself of it. He is a fine
man, with white hair, nearly fifty years old, with a
splendid head and young eyes. He is such a sufferer
from the gout that he lies all day long stretched out on
a deer-skin. He loves as his place of residence only the
island Maklay and the Happy Men’s Islands, which
surround it.

The following little trait is genuine Russian: On his
table stands a lamp, made of the skull of a woman he
once loved, a young girl whom he nursed in the hospital
when as a young man he was studying medicine. Above
the skull is an oil-receiver and above this a green
lamp-shade. By the light of this lamp he does his work
in all parts of the world. Probably it is only a Russian
that would rather linger over the skull of his mistress
than her portrait, and only a Russian who would turn it
to that use. Even the eccentricity of an Englishman
would hardly go to that extent.

Maklay detests and despises Giers. He had long
sought in vain from the Minister of Foreign Affairs
for permission to hoist the Russian flag over his island,
without being able to obtain the concession he sought
for. Then, one fine day, Bismarck caused the German
flag to be hoisted. Maklay telegraphed to Giers. He
replied: “We shall protect you, but no violence!” As
if Maklay, with his poor uncivilized subjects, could use
violence against the German navy. This man has thus
become a German subject.

Originality is most strongly marked as a peculiarity
among other leading men in science and literature
in Russia. What grandiose forms it has assumed in
Tolstoï is well known, but in him, as is also well
known, it has a religious motive. In old Gontcharóf,
on the contrary, who at an early period did his best
work in “Oblómof," it has by a comparative barrenness 
of many years, and by an effeminacy nursed by
the great admiration he has received, reached a height
which renders social intercourse with him difficult.

During the winter, he had promised to read a novel
which he had written for the illustrated weekly
newspaper <i>Niva</i>, in a house where he is a welcome and
honored guest. The sight of a lady whom he did not
know, and who had been invited to be present, so upset
him that he declared that he would not read at all. A
strange countenance, though young and pretty, was
enough to make his anger disconcert him. The following 
little trait shows the irritable passion in him, which
seems to be an outcrop of a genuine Russian rudeness
at the bottom of his character: Turgenief and he had
had a kindred idea of a novel and had talked it over
with each other. Turgenief published his novel first.
It is the one with the title “A Nest of Nobles.”<footnote>Also published with the English title “Lisa.”</footnote>
Gontcharóf reads the novel, becomes furiously exasperated, 
sees Turgenief on the street, and runs after
him shouting, “Stop, thief! stop, thief!” Even now,
when Turgenief’s name is mentioned in his presence, he
foams with rage.

It is evidently not easy to characterize the public to
which the Russian newspapers and periodicals address
themselves throughout the empire. It is too much
scattered; and it is far more difficult than in the world of
readers of other countries for it to gain an expression
and receive examination through “the voice of the
people.” Nevertheless, by many indications we can
conclude that it is docile in a high degree, unprejudiced,
and easily acted upon. The quality of a thorough
appropriation of that which is read ought to be weaker than
in the principal countries of Europe, but the capacity to
receive is, without doubt, greater. The enthusiasm of
the female sex is especially great.

In the provincial towns a caricature of this peculiarity
is very often met with. I saw a lady from Orel, “still
young,” bedecked and powdered, who passed as the
literary oracle of the town. She was an enthusiastic
admirer of Richepin, and quoted boldly : —

<poem><i>L’amour que je sens, l’amour qui me cuit,
Ce n'est pas l’amour chaste et platonique,
Sorbet à la neige, etc.</i></poem>

It was well meant, and in and for itself did not show
bad taste, but was exceedingly unbecoming. Another
lady from Kharkof, old and stiff, was, in her own
opinion, the source of refinement for the place. She
instituted readings of the masterpieces of Russian literature
for the common people, was also a writer, was
loud-voiced, noisy, knew everything that was printed, —
literary to the tips of her fingers and toes.

It is also true that among the Slavic people there is
seen more often than in other places that kind of
enthusiasm for a poet or author which makes a woman worship
him for her whole life. It is hardly an accident that
the lady who for twenty years continued in uninterrupted 
correspondence with Balzac, and at last married
him, was a Pole, Mme. Hanska, of the renowned family
of Rzewuski. Her daughter married a Mniszek.

In our time in St. Petersburg, a lady of a good family
has been seen to leave her husband and her home to run
away with the poet Nadson, then mortally ill, and nurse
him till his death; and she now lives only in his
memory and for his fame. This lady’s feelings for the
poet, and her worship of him, were cruelly made sport
of in the last years of his life and after his death,
although it is, nevertheless, ethnographically significant,
because it shows how strong the faith is in the highest
literary enthusiasm in Russia.

Some months after Nadson’s death, his fair friend
published a somewhat comprehensive correspondence
between the poet and a lady of distinction, an
anonymous countess, who had written to him without ever
having seen him or having made his acquaintance
personally. The letters of the woman are fine but
grotesque. According to all indications, a young, beautiful,
aristocratically educated woman, not long married, had
apparently fallen in love with Nadson without ever
having met him, only from reading his poetry and seeing
his portrait. The exchange of letters lasted for seven
months. Her letters were full of fire and constantly
more passionate. His answers were not without tenderness, 
yet calm and comparatively cold, although it can
be seen he had been much moved by this wonderful love,
which came to him so unsought and unexpected. Then
he dies. Shortly after, according to the preface of the
editress, the fair writer of the letters also died, but not
until she had obtained from her husband his word of
honor that he would give his consent to the publication 
not only of the letters which she had received
from the poet, but of those which she herself had
written.

For several months this correspondence was the
subject of the attention and sympathy of the Russian
reading world. Then it was discovered, as had been
first suggested in the <i>feuilleton</i> of a newspaper as a
derisive conjecture, that the poet and his fair friend
had been the victims of a bold forgery. From what
motive it is uncertain, but a lady who frequented the
house, at first continually entertained the friend with
accounts of a certain countess of her acquaintance, who
lived in a state of hero-worship for Nadson. Then she
began to bring letters, said that she was willing to carry
back the answers, and thus for more than half a year
had kept the intrigue on foot. First she was compelled
to admit the death of the countess — for the very good
reason that she had never lived; then she confessed that
she had fabricated all the anonymous protestations of
love. It is unimportant whether her motive had been
her desire to make herself interesting, a disposition to
mystify, or only a mania for romancing and a vigorous
imagination. The only thing that is significant about it
is that the whole of the Russian public found nothing
unusual or incredible in such a personal passion, evoked
by black on white, without personal influences.

What is still more remarkable, you will not infrequently 
find in the men a similarly exalted nature,
readily receptive of literary enthusiasm. I think it is
in unison with the fact that certain types, among the
educated Russians especially, have an uncommonly great
inclination to cultivate a life of emotion. Just so far
as, by aid of the life and literature, one can comprehend
the domain, which it is so difficult to penetrate, they
seem to fall more deeply in love and with more reverence
than in our time is the rule in other countries. The
very young Russian expects a kind of spiritual aid and
salvation from the woman he loves. The older man,
when in love, tries to supply his wants by sustained
homage. It is the same propensity to worship which
leads the men of the lower classes in hordes to the
religious sects and mystics. And it is this which in the
domain of literature becomes an exquisite sensibility.

In spite of the great size of the empire, authorship is
not economically remunerative in Russia. Except the
two greatest poets, and some journalists without
conscience, no one earns money there by his labor with his
pen. But in a deeper sense, perhaps, in no other place
is it better rewarded to expose one’s emotions and
thoughts in an article, an essay, or a larger book. The
author is understood by great groups of people with
a cordiality, and is appropriated with an intensity and
devotion which are exceptional elsewhere.

Everything there which can quench the thirst, the
burning intellectual thirst, is absorbed like dew-drops
on an arid soil.

<h2><small>IX.</small></h2>

<sc>We</sc> had driven out to a large restaurant outside of
Moscow to hear the gypsies sing and see them dance.
Accompanied by the male members of the families, they
came in crowds, with the chief of the tribe at the head,
into the room where people sit and eat in the evening,
and sang a series of wild, wonderfully sonorous songs.
Several of the young girls dance; a dance which had
nothing European in it, a dance for which only the free
space of a square between the chair and the table is
required, because the dancer, in a contracted place,
moves every fibre of her body while in apparent repose.
This pantomime, which is a whirlwind within these
limits, is Asiatic or African. The song, on the other
hand, to which the Russians take great pleasure in
listening, barbaric as it sounds, is less original. If several
of the melodies are really gypsy tunes, still the mass of
them are, in fact, Russian national songs, which the
gypsies have appropriated and made their own. And
the language which they sing is Russian. Evidently the
musical taste of the Russian peasant, the poetic
character of the Russian national songs, have set their own
stamp upon the spirit of this foreign race so
insusceptible to external influences, so that the Russian, who seeks
among the gypsies for that which is unlike himself, for
the strange and the new, unknown to himself, finds not
a little of his own.

These were the thoughts which the grotesque song
and dance first awakened in me, and when they were
expressed they led by a connection of thought to a
conversation about the Russian peculiarity and power of
assimilation in architecture and the plastic art. This started
many ideas, and now, after the lapse of a year, brings
me to giving such an account as I can of Russia’s artistic
originality in the past and in the present.

The Russians early showed originality in the art of
building. While the Scandinavians hewed the tree in
order to make their oldest log-houses, the Russians placed
the trunks of the trees one above the other, and fastened
them at their outer ends, so as to make walls. We do
the Russians injustice, therefore, when, without further
investigation, we call their art of building Byzantine,
for the Byzantine art has in its forms not the least
suggestion of a previous log-building. It was only in the
eleventh century that the Russians began to erect
churches after the Byzantine types, and even then they
ornamented them with Asiatic and Slavic elements.

The Scythian burial mounds, which have been opened
in the middle of this century, have brought to light a
medley of purely Greek and of Asiatic-Slavic objects of
art. Many of the antique Russian ornaments which
represent the forms of animals or plants, show in
themselves a kind of animals and plants which have never
existed in Russia, the influence of the East, of Persia,
nay of India. But the Russian reproduction, which is
free from any influence from Byzantium, has its distinct
peculiarities.

It is different with the production of religious images,
the representation of saints. In this domain Russia
has been and Russia has become wholly Byzantine. On
this point it has not separated in any respect from the
rest of the Greek Catholic Church of Eastern Europe.
But, so far as religious architecture is concerned, there
the oldest Russian churches are plainly distinguished
from the unmixed Byzantine style, by their slender
forms and the endeavor to tower into the heavens.

At the end of the twelfth century Russian art had
already become so advanced that it was not behind that
of Western Europe nor of Byzantium. The Russian
art-craftsmen understood how to work in metal with
such dexterity that their fame extended far and wide.
In the middle of the thirteenth century, the French
ambassadors found them in the Tatar-Mongolian service.
The holy Louis of France sent an embassy from Cyprus
to the great Khan of Tatary, whose force at that time
occupied a large part of Russia. The messengers found
a Russian architect and a French goldsmith working for
him. And Du Plan Carpin, who in 1246 was sent by
Innocent IV. to the great Khan Gajuk, and who described
the pomp and wealth of the Tatar Court, speaks of a
Russian goldsmith who was a favorite of the Khan,
and who had made a throne of ivory, adorned with gold
and precious stones and ornamented with bas-reliefs.

It is utterly improbable that the Tatars, in the long
time they ruled Russia, should have tried to give a
different direction to the artistic taste and style of the
people. Nomads as they were, they had no artistic style
of their own, and did not trouble themselves about the
Russians, except to get money out of them. But the
Tatar Khans, in all probability, served as means of
communication between the Asiatic races who possessed an
artistic style, on the one hand, and the oppressed
Russian people, on the other. The Russian artists who
resided among them looked deeply into the art forms
of the interior of Asia, which were new to them, and
they remembered them when they came home. In 1247
the Russian national hero and saint, Alexander Nevsky,
celebrated for his victories over the Swedes and the
German order of knights, was obliged to pay a personal visit
to the camp of the golden hordes, and was thence taken
to the great Khan himself, in order to obtain a desired
alleviation and mitigation of the conditions of vassalage.
The journey took two years, and shows how many points
in common there were between the two courts, and how
easily impressions must have been received.

In this respect, I am greatly struck by a quotation by
Viollet-le-Duc in his work on Russian art, from Marco
Polo, the famous Venetian traveller, the first European
who (in the thirteenth century) travelled in and described
Asia. In this it is shown that a strong influence from
Eastern Asia has been effective in the production of the
gilded and colored metal cupolas, the variegated roofs
and highly colored walls in Russia. He thus describes
the palace of the great Khan in the city of Khanbalu :

“<i>La sale est si grant et si larges, que bien hi menuient
plus de six milles homes. Il ha tantes chambres que c'en
est mervoilles à voir. II est si grant et si bien fait que
ne a home au monde que le pooir en aüst qu’il le seust
miaus ordrer ne faire et la covreture desoure sunt tout
vermoile et vers bloies et jaunes et de tous colors et sunt
envertrée si bien et si soitilement, qu’il sunt respredisant come
cristiaus, si que mont ou loigne environ le palais luissent.
Et sachiés que cele covreuse est si fort et si ferméement
fait que dure maint ans</i>.”<footnote>“The palace is so large and broad that it will hold more than six
thousand men. There are so many rooms that it is a wonder to see.
It is so large and so well built that no man in the world could ask for
or do it better, and the roof of it is vermilion and blue and yellow glass
of all colors, and it is so well and so skilfully varnished that it shines
like crystal, so that the palace glistens far in the distance. And know
that this roof is strong, and so firmly built that it has endured for
many years.”</footnote>



Although Russian scholars like Strogonof and
Martinof have zealously fought against Viollet-le-Duc’s
theories about the Tatar and Indian influence in Russian
architecture and ornamentation, he seems to me to be
right in his view that the Russian art of building is
composed of elements which are almost wholly borrowed
from the East.

Russian art has been essentially religious, because the
religious sentiment in Russia (as in Poland) has been
fused with love for the fatherland and the place of birth.
The question with the clergy was how to fasten the
attention of the people upon religious subjects, and, since
the common people could not read, religious painting
was employed as a kind of figurative language; and, in
order that this language should be understood at all
times, all changes were avoided. A hierarchical canon
was borrowed from the Byzantine masters, and in the
lapse of centuries nothing whatever has been changed
in the form and stamp of the images. The holy icon
was a national symbol, like the flag in later times,
revered and unchangeable as a coat-of-arms; it
represented a grave, thin, ascetic person in a long garment,
which was the ideal of the stalwart, carnally minded
men of the earlier days.

But it was only in this domain that Russian art was
stationary. Especially from the moment when Constantinople 
was no longer a Christian city, but in the hands
of the Turks, the Russians ceased to seek there for
artistic forms, and in the fourteenth century their
original production reached its climax. With a prudent use
of their natural materials, they erected churches and
houses which exactly answered to their needs; they
manufactured leather and ornamented it; they wove cloths
and embroidered them in a manner which exactly 
answered to their sense of beauty. At the same epoch
that the unity of the empire was worked out, their
artistic production took on a homogeneous stamp.

They gave to their church edifices, which were symbolical 
of the Russian national characteristics, as much
splendor as possible. They were intended to attract
attention by their size and by the striking outline of
the highest parts. They connected a crown of cupolas
around a central cupola, gave them the form of a tower,
and crowned them with a skilfully worked-out bulb of
gilded or colored metal, which ended in a cross furnished
and united by chains. They gave to the outer walls,
which were covered with tiles, enamelled faïence and
paintings, the character of a radiant, cheerful carpet.
The predominant colors are red, white, and green, which
last color is even specially adapted to the bulb-shaped
metal top.<footnote>Viollet-le-Duc: <i>L’Art Russe</i>, p. 108.</footnote>

And the Tatar rule was scarcely shaken off before
the Muscovites disclosed the greatest talent as artistic
armorers, as masters of chasing gold and silver and
working in <i>niello;</i> and they supplied all the neighboring
countries with embroidered linen and artistically
manufactured leather. Their embroidery is distinguished,
like the vignettes on their old manuscripts, by the
harmonious combination of colors. They have, upon the
whole, a keener sense of the harmony of colors than for
plastic beauty. Since the law for them as painters is
not inventive power but fidelity, they sought to atone for
the Byzantine stiffness of their figures and the
lifelessness of their paintings by surrounding them with gold,
precious stones, and pearls, and thus change the images
to a kind of gorgeous decoration. And since they did
not dare to make any change, and as no kind of 
originality could be exhibited in the treatment of the head
and countenance of the holy persons, they strove, in
consequence, to make amends by encircling these heads
with golden halos, inlaid with pearls and precious stones,
and engraved with the most delicate appreciation of art,
and by ornamenting the breast of the image with plates
inlaid with gold and silver in blazing designs, and
worked in <i>niello</i> with arabesques. Some of these halos
and breast-plates from the sixteenth century, with small
green leaves and small blue flowers inlaid in the gold
matte, or with green in different shades, enclosed by
white lines, and with single black leaves and black
geometric lines in the gold, are of a beauty, of a
fascinating, inspiring loveliness, of which no description can
convey any idea.

The common houses, built of the trunks of trees,
remind one of the manner of building in Switzerland
and Norway. Kindred material has produced kindred
forms, even if the peculiar Russian stamp is easily
recognizable. Thus even before the time of Peter the
Great, Russia had fully developed its artistic peculiarities. 
In so far as the foreign invasion which ensued
did not place itself at the service of these peculiarities,
it only succeeded in retarding or stopping their development 
until the national spirit in this century took a
new start in artistic as well as in other domains.

The nineteenth century has brought an art of painting
to Russia for the first time. Catharina collected
pictures in the Hermitage, and founded an academy of art
in order to obtain artists for her empire as other
countries have them. But what they painted, they never
sold. The rich Russian of her day bought only foreign
pictures; and, in order not to make an utter failure, the
native artists then began, as well as they could, to 
imitate the art of painting of other countries. Thus there
sprang up several generations of academicians, imitators
of David, who painted Spartans and Romans with bare
legs and flowing mantles.

The national revival of 1812, which was quickly felt
in the literature, had hardly any effect upon art.
Nicholas secured two court painters, Beylof and Kotzebue, —
the former of whom has become known by a cold
academical painting, “The Last Day of Pompeii,” and
the latter by his battle-pieces, representing the victories
of Suvórof and Kutúzof, which of necessity resemble
all such scenes of victory of former days. A single
artist comes to the front at this time, Ivánof, who is
now so celebrated, the painter of a single painting, which,
however, was never finished.

It was Gogol, who had formed a friendship with
Ivánof, who gave him the idea of this picture from
sacred history, which was to be a prodigy, and which,
since he was never content with the execution of his
plan, made the artist continually begin anew. For
twenty consecutive years, Ivanof busied himself with
this work, “The Coming of Christ.” A throng of men
are standing on the banks of the Jordan, about John the
Baptist. The looks of all are fixed upon a point in the
distance, at which John points with his hand. Here
over the highland Jesus appears, a sad man, drawing
near to the throng, grazing the ground with his divine
feet. He seems to be half beatified.

The characterization in these heads was executed with
persistent passion. On the other hand, the coloring is
weak. In Tretiakof’s gallery in Moscow, a gold mine
for the study of Russian art, you can trace a whole
series of the attempts through which the painting has
attained to its final form.

The unwearied study of Ivánof, prompted by true
genius, is the only great protest against the academic
art under Nicholas. The Tsar, who would be autocrat
over all things and all men in his empire, and who to the
best of his ability influenced poetry and poets also, —
it was he who made Pushkin busy himself with the
history of Russia, — also desired to have a noble and
conservative art, partly in a general way as an ornament
to his reign, and partly to solve the problem of
glorifying his own exploits. He succeeded only in destroying
the courage of independent men of talent, and nipping
them in the bud.

It is only in the last twenty-five years that there has
existed a real Russian school of painting, and that the
Russian lovers of art no longer go to foreign countries
when they wish to adorn their walls. It was when, with
the emancipation of the serfs, which liberated about fifty
millions of men, the great blast of freedom spread over
Russia, that the artists set to work, and on their
canvases — frequently of the greatest possible dimensions
— placed important incidents from their national life,
very much as the authors at the same time began to write
novels in four volumes about society in Russia. And
now it became quite the fashion to be interested in
Russian art, as it recently had been the fashion to do
homage to everything foreign. The artists made good
sales, and, among their customers sometimes found a
Mæcenas like Tretiakof, who alone has founded a
collection of Russian paintings which is many times greater
and very much better than that of the Hermitage.

A relationship is now disclosed between the course of
development of literature and art. Both move with the
same force and speed from an aristocratic romanticism
to a kind of realistic representation of the people. In
literature the path leads from the refined heroes of
Pushkin and Lermontof to Tolstoï’s and Dostoyevski’s
dwelling upon the simple-hearted. In art, the path has
taken its course from the expounders of the deeds of
the great and the elegance of the upper circles of society
to the bald and sad pictures of the lot in life of the
oppressed and unhappy. So far as artistic fidelity to
reality is concerned, Russia now stands far above Poland,
and close to France.

It is quite true that the academy in St. Petersburg is a
sort of artistic hierarchy. The same <i>Tchinovnisme</i>
(official spirit) prevails there as everywhere in Russia. The
chief authorities in this establishment have no idea of
art. At the head, for form’s sake, stands Prince Imperial
Vladimir, and an ex-governor acts under him. The same
subjects are constantly given to all students: Priams who
come to sue for Hector’s corpse. It is prescribed from
which side the light shall come, what person shall stand
in the foreground, etc. It is of no use that the student
is much more interested in an old apple-woman at the
corner than for King Priam and his whole court. It is
Priam and Hecuba that he must paint. — “What is
Hecuba to him?”

Among the modern artists of Russia there is a group
of decorative colorists. The best known among them
is not a Russian, though he constantly exhibits in
Russia. It is a Pole, <i>Semiradski</i>, who has been under the
influences of Makart. He will be recollected by the
reader from his pictures, of which the photographs have
everywhere been widely scattered, “The Living Torches,”
“The Sword Dance,” “The Girl or the Vase?” That
which is attractive in him and which he can impart is
not the highest art, which paints the sentiment of a
scene or the expression of emotion. What he aspires to
is the correct representation of things and the
picturesque splendor of fabrics.

Endowed with less dramatic power than he, but otherwise 
akin to him, is the Russian <i>Makovski</i>, an artist
very pleasing as a colorist, but of little psychological
power. He exhibited in 1887, in St. Petersburg, a great
painting, bought by an American: “Tsar Alexis Choosing
a Bride.” The subject had a patriotic interest, in so far
as this bride who was sought for was the mother of
Peter the Great. Besides this the artist has availed
himself of the opportunity of painting a throng of beautiful
young girls in the costume of the period. Strangely
enough, he seems to have used one and the same model
— his pretty wife — for all the young women among
whom Alexis shall make his choice. The whole does
not perceptibly rise above simple costume art. Neither
can his later picture, “The Death of Ivan the Terrible,”
which has been much talked of, be regarded as much
superior to that style of art. In two of the figures there
is expression: in the frightened fool, who is lying at the
feet of the Tsar, and in the white-haired Russian
dignitary, with a white beard, who, with eyes as if fixed with
fear, looks over the game of chess at the drooping man;
the other spectators assume theatrical attitudes.

A unique position has also been achieved in the latest
Russian art by Verestchagin, just as well known — in
Denmark also — for his extraordinary natural gifts and
for his abuse of his talents. His biography has found
its way into our literature, and a large number of his
paintings have been seen in Copenhagen. In connection
with this fact, it ought to be mentioned that only too
large a number of the paintings which have been seen
here were duplicates, which are far inferior to
Verestchagin’s originals. When he chooses he is able to do
great things as a colorist. And among his far too
numerous paintings there are not a few which, like his
“Field of the Dead,” remain ineffaceably impressed upon
the memory of the beholder. He who wishes to judge
him correctly ought not to be content with studying
what he has himself selected for export and international
exhibition by electric light, with the accompaniment of
hand-organ music, but he should visit the collection of
his paintings in Tretiakof’s gallery in Moscow.
Verestchagin is a genuine Russian, with his bias towards a
rambling life of adventure, and with the extraordinary
compound in his art of ultra-realism and symbolical
mysticism (the allegory of war, for example). There is
a certain connection between him and Tolstoï. He
would be in his sphere as an illustrator of Tolstoï’s
works, and “War and Peace” would be specially
adapted to his talents. His conception of war, as De
Vogüé has correctly felt, is that of the authors who love
peace and describe war.<footnote>E. M. de Vogüé: <i>Souvenirs et Visions</i>, p. 172.</footnote>

Among the modern artists of Russia there are two who
have impressed me above all others, <i>Riepin</i> and <i>Kramskoï</i>.

The <i>forte</i> of Kramskoï, who died in the spring of
1887, was portrait-painting. In Tretiakof’s gallery there
can be seen a whole suggestive series of his vigorously
conceived portraits of the great distinguished Russians
of his day: Hertzen, Byelinski, Turgenief, Dostoyevski,
and others. After his death there was an exhibition of
his works in the academy. There were two religious
paintings: “Christ in the Desert,” emaciated by fasting,
oppressed by the weight of his thoughts; and a huge
unfinished picture, “Christ before Pilate,” besides five
halls full of portraits, the pearl of which, with its
peerless expression, is that of the Little-Russian poet
Chevchenko, who has suffered so much and written so
well.

Kramskoï was born in 1837, in a village in Little
Russia, near the town of Ostrogoïsk. His father was a
petty tradesman; his mother passed her life in the
kitchen. The boy received his first education in the
parochial school. At the age of seven, he began to
model Cossacks in clay; at thirteen he begged his
parents to let him learn the art of painting.
Permission was refused, for everybody in the town knew that
painters “go barefooted.” Having, in the mean time,
drawn everything he saw, and copied all the images in
the church, a year or two later he was sent to Vorónezh,
to the best sculptor there, but remained with him only
three months, being only sent on errands about the town,
and having no other amusement or recreation than a
flogging. From sixteen to twenty he roamed about
Russia, in all directions, touching up pictures for a
photographer who came through Ostrogoïsk. During this
roving life, which brought him an income of two rubles
and a half a month, he read everything he could get
hold of, and was especially enthusiastic over Gogol and
Lermontof. Finally, at twenty years of age, he entered
the streets of St. Petersburg, and was so fortunate as to
gain admission into the academy. He thought he was
standing in the temple of Art.

His disappointment was great. The instruction was
simply horrible. The drawing classes were tolerably
good, but the higher the student rose the worse was the
teaching. No attention whatever was paid to the
individuality of the young men, and there were always the
same biblical or antique subjects. It was then just
twenty years since Ivánof had suffered a similar
disappointment in the academy. But it was just in 1858 that
this artist came with his painting to St. Petersburg.
Kramskoï was strongly impressed by this special picture; 
he felt the force of genius in the conception, and
admired the truth of the expression of the faces. In his
letters he puts the head of St. John on a level with
those of the Venus of Milo and of the Sistine Madonna,
and is scandalized that no one in St. Petersburg has any
eye for anything but the mistakes in drawing in this
grand painting.

Kramskoï had now obtained his first medals, and
lacked only one year of being sent abroad at the expense
of the academy, when he with fourteen comrades
suddenly left, disgusted at the instruction they received.
It is these fifteen men who have extricated Russian art
from routine. Kramskoï married early, and his house
was the place where the young men met. He himself,
who was regarded as the leader of the movement, worked
unceasingly, and sought for all sorts of knowledge. His
thirst for information and knowledge was so great that
it made him regard every student with veneration. His
simplicity and kind-heartedness conquered the hearts
of all.

At this time, Riepin became his pupil, and soon his
intimate friend. In 1868 he also formed a friendship
with a landscape-painter Vasilief, who later exerted
considerable influence upon him. Vasilief drove him
on to independence of authority of every sort, and
Riepin enchanted him by his bold style. From 1868
Kramskoï was celebrated. He, the old enemy of the
academy, was himself appointed a member of the
academy. Gradually he became more and more of a
colorist. In 1876 he writes from Paris, that he had
hitherto worshipped form alone; that now he was
beginning to understand what the art of painting is. He
becomes an idolizer of Velasquez: “Everything is pale
and insignificant in comparison with him. He paints
with his nerves. The impression is <i>crushing;</i> there is
no other word for it.”

Kramskoï died in his vocation. While, in 1887, he
was painting the portrait of Rauchfuss, the imperial
physician in ordinary, he dropped his brush, and,
stooping over for it, fell dead on the spot. No one else has
painted the Russian race in so many different
physiognomies as he.

His pupil, Riepin, the greatest living artist of Russia,
has gained special reputation by some historical
paintings: one of the Tsaritsa Sophia after Peter the Great
has driven her from the throne, and the much-talked-about 
Ivan the Terrible, throwing himself broken-hearted 
over his son, whom he has killed by a blow from
his iron-shod cane. The latter is a masterpiece, and
admirably painted. You can almost smell the pools of
blood.

Still, these are not the paintings which are the most
characteristic of Riepin’s talent. They are those in
which he has represented his own age. There is a
simple strength in them, a profound and genuine
earnestness, and a fascinating heartiness. He has caught upon
his canvas what, in the strict sense of the word, may be
called modern Russia. His pictures, on that account,
are regarded in certain circles as paintings with a
purpose, — radical paintings. You will find in his works
the types of the intelligent young men of the day, of the
female students with short hair and wise expression.
He has painted the <i>burlaki</i>, who drag the boats on
the Volga up against the stream. The expression in
the depraved or resigned countenances of these bent,
sweating laborers, with the tense muscles under their
tatters, is admirable. He is fond of subjects like the
departure of the recruits, the simple, every-day scene
frequently met with; the young man’s departure from
family and home; or like “The Return of the Exile,” a
picture which never ceases to be thrilling from its very
simplicity. The look cannot be forgotten which the
mother and sister, astonished and half frightened, not
yet glad, cast upon the emaciated young form, in the
sorry clothes, which silently glides in through the door.

The profound sympathy in this art veils the remorselessness 
of the realistic representation.

There is in Russia at present only one eminent sculptor, 
who is of equal importance with these painters, and
that is Antopolski, one of the few men of Jewish descent
who have made themselves known in the history of
sculpture. He passed his youth in great poverty, and
was learning the trade of shoemaker in St. Petersburg
when his talent was brought to light. Baron Günzberg,
the rich and genial banker of St. Petersburg, took an
interest in and supported him, until, quickly enough, he
was able to support himself by his art. After having
been a long time in Rome, he is now a resident of Paris
and enjoys a European reputation.

Antopolski’s “Christ” may, perhaps, be remembered
from Julius Lange’s “Art of Sculpture.” Bound, with
his feet joined close together, Christ is presented to the
people in a form executed with a melancholy realism, in
the costume of the time, with broad sandals under his
feet, his hair fast bound to his brow by sweat under the
burning sun, — an earnest and truly Jewish type. He
looks a little down before him, but the look is
contemplative; he accepts with manly firmness the ignominy
that the cry of the populace prefers Barabbas to him.
There is a Russian stoicism in this look.

Another celebrated statue of Antopolski, representing
the dying Iván the Terrible, is not less interesting. The
Tsar sits in his arm-chair, awaiting the coming of death.
The position has unquestionably been affected by
Houdin’s “Voltaire:” the hand which, groping, anchors
itself on the arm-chair. There is something in the
look as if he saw, in his dying glance, the thirty-five
hundred men whom he has condemned to death pass
slowly before him. Lange has the phrase, “It is like
a soliloquy of Macbeth.”

In Baron Günzberg’s house, rich in works of art, there
is a very admirable bust which Antopolski has made of
Peter the Great, of large size, idealized into a hero, with
royal beauty and the stamp of immense power of will.
In the same place, there is also a captivating bust of a
lady, the likeness of Baron Günzberg’s deceased wife.
Among his other works, a statue of Spinoza, smiling and
contemplative, deserves special mention.

But if the art of sculpture thus has at present only
one great name to point to, yet there is, nevertheless,
great ability in this field in Russia, and a great deal of
plastic talent finds employment in the service of art
industries. It is one of the peculiarities of Russian
society that all the anniversaries, all the jubilees, which
fall to the lot of persons of high position are celebrated
by the presentation of one or more pieces of silver or
gold artistically designed. Not infrequently a jeweller
receives an order from a society or corporation with
permission to go as high as twenty-five thousand rubles,
provided he can produce a real work of art. The Russian
taste for color is employed in a more pleasing manner in
such small works than in large architectural designs.
The jewellers in Moscow understand how to combine
both high and pale colors with gold and silver matte
with extraordinary beauty. Unfortunately, the most
that we had the opportunity of seeing at the Scandinavian 
exhibition in Copenhagen was less characteristic of
the Russian people, because the workman in part had
often been carried away by French designs and patterns,
and in part because, as a whole, this art came rather
from the mountaineers of the Caucasus than from the
Russian people proper. They seem here to have
preferred to work with elegance rather than with
individuality, and especially to have preferred to present proofs
of the talent of the Russians in imitation, rather than
their remarkable gifts of compelling the foreigners on
their own soil to create artistic effects in the Russian
style and spirit.

<sc>Even</sc> if the Russians of our day are not the
descendants of the races which in remote times ruled the
countries north of the Black Sea, they are at least their
heirs, and he who is much interested in modern Russia
gladly turns to the Greek and Roman authors for their
descriptions of these countries and their climates, and
for their accounts of the people and their manners and
customs.

What made the deepest impression upon the classical
authors is without doubt the cold, the eight months’
winter, which Herodotus describes (iv. 28), and which is
followed by a cool and rainy summer. That whole
arms of the sea and broad rivers are frozen, so that
people can drive and ride over them, is a terrible prodigy
to them. We read in Ovid: “They protect themselves
against the cold by skins and sewed trousers, and of
the whole form only the face is to be seen. The hair
often rattles from the ice which hangs on it, and the
beard shines with the frost which covers it. The wine
keeps the shape of the bottle, when the bottle is broken
in pieces, and they do not pour it out, but divide it up.
Why should I say that all the brooks are stiffened by
the cold and that they dig water out of the sea that they
can break into pieces? Even the Ister (Danube), which
is not less broad than the Nile, and which, through its
many mouths, mingles its waters with the sea, freezes,
when the winds harden its waves, and steals out into
the sea under a covering of ice. Where the ships went
before, people go on foot. The horse’s hoof stamps on
the frozen plain, and over these new bridges, above the
flowing waves, the Sarmatian oxen drag the barbaric
vehicles. You may hardly believe me, but, since I shall
gain nothing by telling a falsehood, I ought to be
believed: I have seen the immense Black Sea hardened
into ice, which like a smooth shell lay upon the
immovable waters. And I have not only seen it, but I have
trodden on the hard ocean plain and walked with dry
feet over the sea.” (<i>Tristia</i>, iii. 10.)

In the next place, the lack of trees in these regions
made a great impression on those who came here from
Greece and Italy. Of the country of the Sarmatians,
Herodotus says that it is entirely bare both of cultivated
and wild trees; of the Scythians he relates how for
want of wood they cook the flesh of their sacrificed
animals in the stomachs of the latter, with fire which
is made of their bones (iv. 21, 61). Ovid turns back
again and again to the melancholy want of vegetation
in the region. “No trees, no vines in the Getian land.
Rarely in the open fields is there a bush, which even then
does not flourish.” (<i>Tristia</i>, iii. 12; <i>Ex Ponto</i>, iii. 1, 7.)

In remote times, as is well known, all the races on
the plains which became Russia were mingled together
under the names of the Scythians, Sarmatians, Getians,
and some others. It is impossible now to determine how
far they were the ancestors of the Slavs. But that the
latter generally had ancestors among them, is evident
from the character of the bones which have been found
in the old burial mounds (<i>Kurgans</i>) in Southern Scythia.<footnote>Elisée Reclus: <i>Géographie universelle</i>, v. 299.</footnote>

Several places in Herodotus have already drawn our
thoughts in this direction. Thus the place (iv. 75)
where he relates of the Scythians that they never wash
their bodies in water, but use steam baths instead.
(Comp. Nestor’s Chronicle, v.) But the chapter in
Herodotus (iv. 5) where he speaks of their myths is
far more remarkable. How Slavic it is even then, that
the common ancestor of their race was a son of the
supreme God, whom he had from a daughter of the river
Borysthenes (Dnieper). Here already is the personification 
of the rivers which is so common in the old Slavic
epics. But still more surprising is the resemblance
between the myths about that Kola-xais, the youngest
son of the common father, prince of the ploughshare, and
Mikula of the <i>bîlinî</i> (the epic poems), the son of the
peasant. Herodotus relates that, while Kola-xais and
his brothers reigned, there fell a plough, a yoke, an ox,
and a bowl, all of gold, down into Scythia from heaven.
When the eldest brothers, one after the other, approached,
they were burned by the gold and driven back by its
glow. But when the youngest came up, the fire was
extinguished, and for that reason they gave him the
whole kingdom. Also Mikula, the child of a village,
the agricultural hero, has a wonderful plough. When
Volga, the bold warrior, with his guard, rides from place
to place to collect taxes from the Slavic towns, he
suddenly hears out in the country the sound of a plough.
He hears the creaking of its woodwork and the grinding
of its ploughshare against the stones. Volga and his
men take a course in the direction of the ploughman,
and ride a whole day without finding any one. Yet the
sound of the visionary plough, and the striking of the
iron against the stones in the furrows, constantly ring in
their ears. Volga rides another day without meeting
any one. As Orestes Miller has remarked, the picture is
developed in this direction, so that it assumes huge
proportions. It becomes a poetic representation of the
boundless plain of which the Russian land is made up.
The farmer draws his furrow in this plain with such a
wonderful skill that they only see in him a divine
workman, the representative and protector of Russian
agriculture.

It is only on the morning of the third day that
Volga reaches the countryman who is ploughing up the
ground with the mighty plough, tearing up the roots of
trees and breaking off fragments of rock. He greets
him and congratulates him. Mikula tells him, in
return, how one day, when people from the neighborhood
came to him and demanded taxes, he gave them all taxes
with his staff. When Volga begs him to join his body
guard (<i>Druzhina</i>), Mikula consents on condition that
one of Volga’s men shall pull his plough out of the
furrow and throw it into a bush. But not five, not
even ten, of his brave men can stir the plough from its
place. Then Mikula comes up alone, and with one hand
seizes the plough and flings it up in the clouds, from
which it falls down into a bush.<footnote>A. Rambaud: <i>La Russie épique</i>, p. 39.</footnote>

As we saw, the plough thus fell down from heaven.
Over and over again, as ethnographic studies make
progress, scholars have occasion to admire the scrupulous
trustworthiness of old Herodotus.

To read Ovid after Herodotus is to be transported five
hundred years in time and from one world to another.
But the poetical lamentations of the over-educated
Roman poet and his letters from Pontus are still one
of the oldest sources of our knowledge of how the
regions which to-day lie on the southwestern frontier
of Russia were inhabited in ancient times, and of their
natural conditions. Poor Ovid! The knowledge we
now have was bought by the misfortune which befell
him, — a misfortune so great and complete that it is
incomprehensible how any one has ever been able to
speak of his lamentations in a careless tone. No author
in the Roman literature had a more original or bolder
talent, and no one met with a more cruel fate. It was
so long before the days of the Russian empire, an actual
exile for life to Siberia. The illegal judgment strikes
him, the finest, most sensuous, most petted poetic nature
of Rome, tears him, even then growing old, out of the
pleasures of home life, away from a wife whom he loves
with the most heartfelt tenderness, after having been
twice unhappily married, away from the circle of his
friends and admirers, away from the city of the world
which is all in all to him, from his fatherland (nay, from
civilization), and drags him over the sea and the salt
waves to the end of the known world. He is landed
solitary and alone in a place where the air itself is
painful to him; where he can endure neither the drinking
water nor the food, cannot protect himself sufficiently
against the climate, cannot find a physician when he is
ill, nor a single man with whom he can exchange ideas
when he is well; where few understand Greek and none
Latin; where he must live in perpetual fear of attacks
from hostile tribes, who swarm about the town and often
enough break in, in constant anxiety lest there should
be attacks from the inhabitants of the town, who were
little less than barbarian; finally, where he cannot once
move outside of the poor strongholds of the town, or own
even the least bit of a garden, of which he so bitterly
feels the want, because there are no gardens in the town,
and personal safety is wholly wanting outside, so that the
land for miles distant remains uncultivated. When the
guards on the towers give the alarm, he, the refined
foreigner, lays hold of his weapons. The coast is inhabited
by Greeks and Getians mixed together, the latter being
the more numerous, and even those who speak Greek
have the Getian accent. Getian and Sarmatian horsemen 
ride through the streets in crowds, clothed in skins,
with long and loose trousers, with long beards and hair
which hangs down over their faces, with knives loose in
their sheaths, their bows in their hands, and their quivers
full of poisoned arrows rattling on their backs. The
hostile Getians also use only arrrows which they have
dipped in poison; they live by robbery alone, come
driving on their horses with the fury of a storm, very
little dismayed by the slight walls of the town, and
many a time their death-bearing shots fly in over the
walls, so that the houses of the town were as if larded
with arrows. Grant that there is a little poetic exaggeration 
in his description of his continual danger, there is
wretchedness enough left. And in this condition Augustus 
and his successor let the most original poet of Rome
pine away, year in and year out, always cherishing
delusive hopes of a milder place of banishment,
separated from everything he loved and had a taste for, and
for a fault which was not a fault; for having got on the
scent of a court secret, which he did not dare to mention,
and which is unknown to us. It is no wonder that he,
with his gentle and timid character, begs for mercy
from the powerful father of the land, with continual
humble adulation. But when we read these prayers
for liberation we feel an involuntary admiration
rising up for the Russian authors who, exiled in our
day in similar circumstances, live and die without a
prayer or a complaint, much less a word of flattery
or adulation for him who exiled them, falling from
their lips.

Putting Ovid’s “Elegies” back on the shelves, and
taking down Nestor’s chronicle in its place, we are fully
a thousand years later in time. The great national
migrations had driven the Slavic races in broad waves
in over Russia. Kingdoms have been founded in
Novgorod and Kief. Together with legends and naïve
conjectures about the more remote times, we have here a
history becoming more trustworthy as we approach the
period of the narrator’s own life, ending with the year
1110. And even from a period concerning which Nestor
has only exceedingly doubtful traditions to depend upon,
he possessed treaties and agreements, genuine documents
of the highest importance, which he incorporates in his
book. He is Russia’s Saxo-Grammaticus, but a hundred
years older than the Danish monk, and his work has the
greater literary value, given to it by the use of the
mother tongue.

What especially attracts the attention of the Scandinavian 
reader is everything which relates to the rule
of the Norsemen in Russia, the statesmanship of the
Varings and their campaign. In the Danish translation
of Nestor’s chronicle, there are given in learned notes all
necessary criticism of the old chronicles and information
as to the present condition of investigation. The
explanation of the Scandinavian words by Gislason, at the
end of the book, is also very instructive.

In historical and psychological respects, a comparison
between the style and descriptions of Nestor and of the
Icelandic sagas is of great interest, especially in those
cases where the chronicles and sagas treat of the same
persons and events. An essay by the Russian scholar
Senkovski on the Icelandic sagas and their relation to
Russian history, which has been translated into Danish,
awakens the attention and sharpens the reader’s capacity
to recognize Nestor’s peculiarities and limitations.<footnote>Annals of the Society of Northern Antiquities, 1847.</footnote>
Senkovski compares, as an example point by point,
<i>Eymundar Saga</i> with the chapters (forty-eighth and
following) in Nestor. The worthy monk here falls far
behind. The saga was composed from the verbal
narrative of Icelanders who had been participants in the
events described, and have the trustworthiness of
eyewitnesses. Nestor, credulously, with many oratorical
embellishments and pious remarks, gives an account of
martial exploits, victories, and defeats, concerning which
he has only an indistinct and unintelligible tradition.
The Icelanders had political talent and ability, in
addition to the skill of the Vikings in tactics and war.
While the monk from the cave-cloister in Kief, without
considering the material difficulties of keeping forces in
the open field, makes the armies of Yaroslaf and Sviatopolk 
stand full three months face to face in battle at
Liubetch; and while he, in biblical fashion, reports the
threatening speeches of the leaders of the armies to the
enemy, and the impatient expressions of the troops at
this derision, the saga shortens the time from three
months to four days, shows what lot and part Eymund,
the chief of the Varings, had in the battle, describes his
flank movement, his attack on them at once from front
and rear, and gives, without any fabrications, embellishments, 
or pious reflections, an intelligible picture, even
if it seems as if the author of the saga had mixed up
the reports of two different battles.

The greatest difference between the cloister spirit and
saga style is felt in the account given by Nestor and in
the saga of Sviatopolk’s (Burisleif’s) decisive defeat
in the revolt against Brother Yaroslaf (the Jarisleif of
the saga). In Nestor it is said, “But towards evening
Yaroslaf conquered, and Sviatopolk took flight. And,
as he fled, the devil came upon him, and his joints were
loosened so that he could not sit on his horse, and they
carried him in a litter, and brought him in his flight to
Berèstije. But he said, ‘Fly with me, for they are
pursuing us.’ And his servants sent a messenger back,
and said, ‘See if any one is coming after us;’ and there
was no one who followed them. And they fled farther
with him, and he was then lying in delirium, and started
up, and said, ‘They are coming after us! Hasten!’ He
could not stay in one place, and flew through Liachland,
pursued by the wrath of God, and came to a desert
place between Liacher and Czecher, and there in a
pitiable manner he ended his life. The unjust and godless
man now had his deserts, when the judgment came upon
him, after his exit from this world, given up to torments
in the next. This was plainly shown by the mortal
pangs which came upon him, and mercilessly drove him
to death; and after death he is suffering everlasting
torments in chains. This has God done as a warning to
the Russian princes,” etc.

In the saga the extract is less theological. It is told
there how the practical Norse chief lays before Yaroslaf
the necessity of letting his rebellious brother be slain.
“For there will never be any end to this misfortune so
long as you both live.” When the king gives the answer
that he will not call upon people to attack his brother,
and then afterwards prosecute them in case they killed
him, Eymund interprets the answer as it suits him,
sallies forth with eleven others, hides himself in a
forest, by the borders of which the hostile army is
encamped, murders the king’s brother, and brings to the
king his severed head. “See here, my lord, if you know
this head.” Yaroslaf turns red. “This deed we
Norsemen have done,” says Eymund, “but now let your
brother be buried in a becoming and honorable manner.”
Yaroslaf answers, “You have done a rash deed, my
friends, which weighs heavily upon me. You have
killed him; then bury him also.” About condemnation
of the event, even on the side of the injured brother, not
a word is said. Senkovski properly notices the improbability 
of attributing to the Varing-Russian heroes of that
age the aversion of the Christian monk to bloodshed.
It was only cowardice that was despicable in their sight.
For the perfidious and bold wrong-doer they had a
respect which was not denied to him even when they were
in arms against them.

The language, as well as the peculiarities of race, of
the ruling warrior caste of Scandinavian Russians was
speedily absorbed by the great Slavic people, largely
because the Varings seldom married any other than
native-born wives; therefore no traces of the Norse mythology
are to be found in Russia. On the other hand, we meet
(especially in the only written epic poem of Russia) not
a few reminiscences of the old Slavic worship of God
and nature. Still, what we know about the mythical
beings is very little. The Slavs worshipped the heavens
by the name of Svarog. The sons of the heavens were
Dazhbog, god of the sun (and wealth. From <i>dazh</i> — day,
and <i>bog</i> — god), and the god of fire, Ogon (Indian, Agni).
The god of the sun had other names besides: Hors and
Volos, who like Apollo was god of the flocks and of the
poets. Perun corresponds to Thor as the god of
thunder. Stribog is the god of the winds. In addition they
worshipped “the damp mother earth;” the spring season,
Vesná; and Morana, the god of death and of winter.
The souls of the dead were called Rusalki. In Russia,
as everywhere else, on the introduction of Christianity,
the heathen forms and ceremonies were not rooted out,
but named anew, and consolidated with the festivals of
the Church. Thus, for instance, the holy Elias, with his
chariot of fire, appears in place of the thunder-god
Perun. There are many songs, which it is the custom
and usage to sing on anniversaries, over the whole of
Russia, which have a mythical origin.<footnote>See Alexander von Reinholdt: <i>Geschichte der Russischen
Litteratur</i>, bk. 1.</footnote>

But an entirely different, copious and valuable source
of knowledge of the old Slavic intellectual life is to be
found at the present time in the <i>bîlinî</i>, which were first
collected and published in this century, — that is to say,
the old Russian epic poems. The first collection of these
appeared in 1804, consisting of songs which had been
collected among the iron-workmen in the department of
Perm. In 1818 a new edition of the collection was
published, with sixty numbers in place of twenty-five. It
was then found out that there were a large number of
epic songs in circulation among the peasants in Northern
Russia. From 1852 to 1856, Sreznevski published <i>bîlinî</i>,
which were recited in these northern departments; yet
it was only in 1859 that the investigations of Rybnikof,
in the regions about the Onéga Lake, made it plain that
Russia had an enormously large unknown national literature 
in the form of popular poems, which it was simply
necessary to collect from the lips of the people. The
isolation caused by the severe climate about the Onéga
Lake, the simple manner of life and naïve mode of
thought of the inhabitants, the superstition and
ignorance, the inability to read and write, have made these
regions a sort of oral Iceland for old Slavic poetry.
Rybnikof was followed by Hilferding, who, in the same
wrild provinces, collected more than three hundred new
songs or new variations. Next comes a garland of poems
published by Kirievski, collected from almost all parts
of Great Russia and Siberia. And in all these songs
the same persons appear, the same adventures happen,
and the same poetical expressions are found.

The best of these poems, and the most of them, turn
upon the oldest memories of the Slavic countries, and
range themselves into two principal circles, the Kief
circle and the Novgorod circle. Sometimes they point
straight back to the heathen Russia and the oldest
Aryan mythology, which lies back of the Slavic
religions. Thus they also present points of comparison
with the holy books of India, and even several, and for
a Scandinavian reader more interesting ones, with the
Edda and the Norse myths.

Maikof succeeded in fixing the eleventh and twelfth
centuries as the period of the most important
song-circle: the Vladimir cycle, whose centre is Kief. He
has proved that in all these poems there is no other
Russia known than that which lies about the Dnieper.
The capital is Kief; there is no mention of Moscow.
The subordinate places are Chernigof, Galitch, Murom,
Smolensk, etc. The Russia of the <i>bîlinî</i> has already
been converted to Christianity, and obeys one prince,
but is in continual war with the nomads in the south
and east. We find ourselves in the period between the
introduction of the orthodox faith and the rule of the
Tatars. Closer examination gives the circumstance
that there is mentioned in the German “Otnit,” from
the twelfth century, an “Ilias of Riuzen,” plainly the
Russian national hero Ilia of Murom, and that in like
manner in the Icelandic Thidrek saga of the thirteenth
century, which is composed from Saxon songs or
traditions from the twelfth century, there is mention of a
Russian King, Vladimir, and his brother Jarl Ilia from
Greece, which means Russia.<footnote>A von Reinholdt, above cited, p. 49. Rambaud: <i>La Russie
épique</i>, p. 155.</footnote>

Now and then, as already stated, we hit upon a
passage in the <i>bîlinî</i> of the Kief circle which call to mind
Norse myths and popular traditions. Thus it is said of
Sviatogor, one of the oldest heroic figures, a Titan with
supernatural strength who is sometimes mixed up with
the Bible Samson, that when, one day, he was lying
stretched out on a mountain, Ilia of Murom, the national
hero, the son of a peasant, in whom the saga figure
Mikula seems to have been born again, wished to
challenge him to single combat. But the most vigorous
blows from Ilia’s club were hardly able to awaken
Sviatogor from his dreams. He thought it was
pebbles that were falling on him. At the third blow, he
says to Ilia: “You are strong among men; remain
strong among them; with me you cannot compare
yourself. The ground could not bear me, so I lay down on
this mountain.” Who does not recall the scene between
Thor and the giant who, at the most vigorous blows of
the hammer of the god, thinks that he was hit by a
falling leaf or acorn!

Another adventure also reminds us of Thor and
Utgardloke. It is an account of how Ilia disappears
in the pocket of the sleeping Sviatogor. (The wife of
the latter hides him there to escape the anger of the
giant.) In just the same way, Thor passes a whole night
in Skrymer’s glove. Both Ilia and Thor here are the
lightning which conceals itself for a long time behind
the clouds, and very significantly Thor, immediately
after coming out of the glove, strikes the giant on his
head with his hammer so that the blood spurts out.

Among other things, Ilia also fights with the robber
Soloveï, who blocks his way to the mountain of the
Sun-prince. This Soloveï has a face of a bird and utters a
horrible bird-cry, whose shriek works such destruction
that the roofs in Vladimir’s palaces fall in. He is,
therefore, the spirit of bad weather and storm, and by his
bird-form calls to mind that giant in the guise of an
eagle who, in Vafthrudnismál, sitting at the end of
heaven, with his wings which are those of an eagle, sets
the winds in motion; or the giant Thiasse, who, in the
guise of an eagle, carries away, conceals, and later
pursues Idun, until he meets his death in the fire which was
kindled for him behind Asgaard’s wall. Bird-forms
everywhere are symbols of storms and bad weather.

There is still another little incident of Ilia’s battle
with the giant which recalls a Norse tradition. As Ilia
finds gold and silver in great quantity in Soloveï’s nest,
so Sigurd finds the red gold under the dragon Fafner. It
is one and the same symbol of the shining beams which
the dark clouds hide under or behind them.

Among Sviatogor’s adventures, in the next place, is one
which greatly reminds us of Thor’s when the giant plays
a trick upon him, and lets him drink out of the horn the
other end of which is in the sea, raises a cat which is the
Midgaard-serpent, and is troubled by an old woman who
is old age. When the giant Sviatogor one day is riding
over the plains, he meets an old man who asks him to
help him put his sack on his back. The hero would lift
the sack with the end of his whip, with his finger-tip,
with his strong hand, — he cannot do it. Then he alights
from his horse and tries with both hands, with 
tremendous efforts, to lift the sack which is so heavy, while the
sweat drops from his forehead. Finally, he thinks he
has got it up to his knee; but it is he himself who has
sunk down to the knees in the ground. In the little
sack, God had put the weight of the whole earth.

We finally find a characteristic incident, which reminds
us of one of our national traditions, where Sviatogor and
Ilia, after having formed a foster-brotherhood, visit
Sviatogor’s old father together. The old man is blind and
apparently impotent. He asks to be allowed to press
Ilia’s hand to see if the Russian <i>bogatyrs</i> (the generic
name of the national heroes) still have strong limbs and
warm blood. At a nod from his friend, Ilia grabs a huge
iron bar glowing in the fire and hands it to the old man.
“Good!” says he to the young hero. “I feel that you
have a strong hand and hot blood.” This is the story of
Holger Danske and the peasant.<footnote>Rambaud: <i>La Russie épique</i>, pp. 41, 50, 111, and following.</footnote>

There is no one among the heroes of these <i>bîlinî</i> who
is more characteristic and typical than this Ilia of Murom.
He belongs to the cycle which has Vladimir, <i>the beautiful
sun</i>, for its centre; but he is treated by the poets as the
son of a peasant, with even more sympathy than the
prince. Regular geological layers can be found in all
the epic poems of Russia; we can see, more or less
plainly, how certain conceptions of nature which are
common to all Aryan peoples about the eleventh century
began to assume a constantly more decided Slavic stamp.
The mythical heroes, which were at first like those of
other countries, like those of the old North, for instance,
become decidedly Russian and decidedly Greek-orthodox.
They are born in a definite Russian village; they are
slain on a definite Russian field. The celestial
mountains, streams, and seas, which, in the oldest mythological
language, indicated clouds, rain, and air, become Russian
mountains like the Ural, Russian rivers like the Dnieper,
and Russian seas like the Caspian Sea. In like manner,
Ave see Ilia also individualized. It is related of him that,
before he makes his appearance as <i>Bogatyr</i>, he sits for
thirty years (the constant expression for a very long
time) immovable and lame. Then two celestial old men
who come to Murom call him up from his sleep of death.
It is in vain that he answers that he can move neither
hand nor foot. When they call to him again, he is able
to raise himself and open the door to them. They give
him a strengthening drink, and he feels an immense
power suddenly rippling through his limbs. Here Ilia
is evidently the same thing as nature, which is
awakened from its long winter sleep.

Ilia is thus roused to action, and his first exploit is to
cultivate the Russian soil; with superhuman strength
he tears up a whole oak forest and tranforms it to arable
land. After that he sallies forth to free peasants, as a
hero of the fields to protect this Russian earth against
monsters, robbers, and heathens. We have seen how in
these conflicts he appears as the God of Thunder. He
shoots an arrow from his bow against an oak, and the
oak is entirely split to pieces as if struck by lightning;
he swings the club like Perun, the hammer like Thor.

But then we see him like a true Russian hero
travelling from Murom to Tchernigof to free the land from
robbers who were exhausting it. We see him reject the
money and the sovereignty which the <i>muzhiks</i> of
Tchernigof would confer upon him, and hasten to Kief to
Vladimir, to aid the national prince against his many
enemies. And he becomes chief <i>Ataman</i> over Vladimir’s 
forces. In some of the <i>bîlinî</i>, at this point, he
develops in entire consistency with the popular ideal.
When Vladimir, one day, offers him an insult, he gives
his men a sound thrashing, runs down into the courtyard, 
batters the gold tiles down from the roof of the
palace and the gold crosses from the churches, and with
the gold he entertains all the <i>muzhiks</i> and beggars of the
region at a feast, where mead and spirits flow freely. In
other <i>bîlinî</i> he is suspected by Vladimir, because he is
slandered by the Prince of the Boyárs at his court,
and he is thrown into prison to starve to death. He
remains there for three years, secretly supported by
Vladimir’s young daughter. When Kief was attacked
by a huge Tatar host, and Ilia was bitterly missed,
Vladimir, led by the advice of his daughter, finds in the
underground prison the hero, “the old Cossack,” who is
sitting at a plain table, reading the Evangelists.
Vladimir, on his knees, begs him for help, not for himself, but
for the churches of the Blessed Virgin, and for the
widows and the fatherless in the holy Russia. Then
Ilia discloses himself as the Christian knight, who
protects the defenceless and has the churches near to his
heart. Nay, he travels straight to Constantinople
(Tsargrad) and liberates the Tsar from the heathen
army.

It is now peculiarly Russian that, before this great
military hero starts out into the wide world, he makes the
vow that he will never soil his hands with blood. The
few incidents of wildness that are met with in his
history are plainly mythical elements, as when he kills the
robber Soloveï, and afterwards the terrible Amazon or
<i>Polenitsa</i> (who at last shows herself to be his daughter),
tearing them both into small pieces, and scattering these
upon the earth to make it fertile. Otherwise he
performs all his exploits with the greatest calmness, and,
while he despises danger, he is fond of making 
derisive jokes after the manner of the Russian peasants.
Like a good son of a peasant he began by helping his
old parents. Everywhere, as at Vladimir’s table, he
compels the persons of position to give place to those of
low degree. Like a genuine <i>muzhik</i> he sometimes drinks
deeply and sleeps out his drunkenness; but he is open-hearted 
towards his prince to the last degree, and when
the latter has taken it ill and punished him cruelly for
it, he is ready to forget the injury as soon as he hears
that there is any question about the cause of the defenceless. 
He never brags of his victories, wishes that honors
may redound to the glory of Russia, and, in his aversion
to soiling his hands with blood, spares his enemies when
he can do so, and sets his captives free.

It is a very remarkable instance of Russian imagination 
that a well-known <i>bîlîna</i>, with the title “Why there
are no more heroes in holy Russia,” for the purpose of
increasing the impression of the power there is in this
national hero, represents Ilia of Murom as stronger
than Fate itself, to which this people otherwise so
patiently submit, and which conquers all the other
heroes.

Ilia had become fully three hundred and fifty years
old, but his powers were less impaired than Stærkodder’s
as an old man, when, one day, while riding through a
forest, he read on a stone the inscription, “If you go to
the right you will become rich, if you take the middle
road you will be married, if you go to the left you will
be killed.” The old Cossack, as he is called here, after
considering it, concludes that it does not become his age
now to seek for wealth or marriage. It is more becoming 
for him to ride in the road in which death is found.
After riding a short distance he meets with a band of
robbers, but disperses them, turns back and writes upon
the stone, “I rode to the left and was not killed.” By
the middle road he comes to a splendid castle. A king’s
daughter, dazzlingly beautiful, first waits upon him, and
then asks him to share her couch on a bed of silk and
eider down. But the old hero, suspecting treachery,
declares that in his country it is the custom for women
to lie down first, seizes the princess by her belt and
throws her on the bed, and then rushes down into the
vaults of the palace. He liberates the forty princes she
has held imprisoned there, causes the enchantress to be
broken on the wheel, and writes a second time on the
guide-board at the cross-roads, “I rode by the middle
way and was not married.” By the road to the right he
finally finds an iron cross and under it a great treasure.
He divides it into three parts and builds three churches
with the gold: one for the merciful Saviour, one for St.
Nicholas from Mozhaïsk, and one for the bold St. George,
so he can properly write on the stone: “I rode to the
right and did not become rich.”

From this <i>bîlina</i> we can perhaps best learn with what
strength the Russian imagination has felt obliged to
endow its heroes. His most extraordinary trait of
character, nevertheless, is in the exhibition of self-sacrifice.
He does not, like the heroes of the West, perform the
act from a feudal devotion to his prince nor from a
feeling of duty to him; still less, like the Norse heroes,
from ambition, but from a magnanimous tenderness for
children and the abandoned, or to protect the country
and its religion. It is the common weal, not the
happiness of the prince or his own honor, which lies near to
his heart. While Achilles never pardons Agamemnon
for the insult he received from the king, Ilia forgets on
the spot what Vladimir has done to him. On that
account the Russian scholars, like Orestes Miller, seek
to show that Ilia’s feeling of duty is conclusively
significant in relation to the idea of community, which
is the Russian fundamental idea for the Slavophiles.
They see in Ilia’s indifference towards mere personality,
and his willingness to serve the common cause, a symbol
of the original tendency of the Russian spirit to
community in family, society, and state.<footnote>Rambaud, above cited, 62, 113. A. von Reinholdt, above cited,
p. 69. Reinholdt has extracts from the <i>bîlinî</i> translated in the
original metres.</footnote>

Besides this popular epic poem, moreover, the
Russian literature possesses in “The Story of Igor’s
Campaign” an old epic of art of very high rank, corresponding
to what the “Song of Roland” is for the French, and
the <i>Niebelungenlied</i> for the Germans, but which,
nevertheless, has the fault, which would be very serious in
the eyes of the Germans, of being much shorter.

This was written a very short time after the event
which it describes: the campaign which Igor Sviatoslavitch, 
one of the princes from Novgorod-Sieversk, in
1155, undertook against the pagan Polovtsians, a nomadic
tribe of Turco-Finnish descent, who lived on the banks
of the Don and were continually attacking the careless
Russians. Igor was a cousin of the Prince Imperial of
Kief, who the year before, with other princes, had
conducted a victorious expedition against the Polovtsians.
Now, for his own part, he wished to cover himself with
honor, and therefore sallied forth with his brother
Vsevolod, “the wild bull,” to whom he was greatly
attached, and his son Vladimir. But his expedition
was unfortunate; he was himself taken prisoner and
with great difficulty escaped from captivity by the aid of
a trusty esquire. We have the same incident related in
the old Russian chronicle of the monk Ipat, one of those
who wrote a continuation of the chronicle of Nestor,
and we can see from that the endeavor of the unknown
poet to confine himself to the historic truth. It is quite
true that we find in the “Story of Igor” many traditions 
or mythical stories incorporated with the principal
event, while the monk who is the author of the
chronicle has carefully eliminated every heathen expression
and element, but still there is a more evident attempt in
the chronicler to endow the heroes with fine qualities.
When the battle is lost the princes are advised to fly.
In the chronicle they refuse to do so; they will not
desert their men, their common soldiers, but will live or
die with them. The story has nothing of this. And
when Igor is taken prisoner according to the chronicle
he refuses for a long time to escape from captivity,
because he has given his word to the princes of the
Polovtsians, until at last the regard for Russia, now so
exposed to the enemy, moves him. In the story he is
at once ready for flight.

When we mentally compare the “Story of Igor” with
the heroic lays of the Edda, which are probably of
greater antiquity and, at any rate, describe a rougher
and wilder form of national life, the Russian poem, no
doubt (in contradistinction to the Niebelungennôt), has
the inequality and lyrical form as well as the predilection 
for a vivid dramatic representation in common with
the Norse poems, but the essential feature of the Slavic
epic is still entirely distinct. In the first place, the
latter possesses an individuality. We do not know the
author’s name, but his entity stands out very distinctly
before the reader, rich as it is in enthusiasm and piety.
He speaks in his own name, stands as an individual
responsible for his words, is conscious of a personal style
of composition which is less flighty and fantastic than
the style of the older seers and bards, whom he in other
respects admires. In the next place, you feel that his
love for the poetic art is not less strong than his
admiration for the deeds of the princes of his day. He is an
enthusiast for poetry. It is, as he expresses it, his
intention to free himself from the poetic traditions; he does
not wish to borrow from his predecessors “the old words.”
From the <i>bîlinî</i> we can see what he meant by this.
There is found in them, just as in the Homeric poems,
a standing supply of descriptive epithets. The
mountains are always <i>gray</i>, the sea always <i>blue</i>, the sun
always <i>red</i>. The earth is <i>our mother, the damp earth</i>.
They always run on their <i>swift</i> feet, always take another
by his <i>white</i> hand, etc. The unknown poet has plainly
wished to adopt as little of that as possible. Nevertheless, 
we meet in him certain constantly recurring expressions 
which are evidently inherited, as, to drink the Don
dry with his helmet, to set ten falcons on a flock of
swans, to sow the earth with human bones, and certain
constantly recurring epithets, as, Vsevolod, <i>the wild bull</i>,
the <i>falcon</i> Igor, and his son the <i>young falcon</i>, and others.

As a man, the author of “Igor’s Campaign” is far milder
in his emotions than the author of even the mildest of
the heroic poems of the Edda, “The Songs of Helge.”
The style in which, in his poem, Yaroslávna expresses
her longing for Igor during his absence in the war, and
her fear for the life of her lover, is more like Ingeborg’s
languishing lamentations in Tegner’s poem than it is to
Sigrun’s loss of Helge in the Edda. And the whole life
of emotion and nature, which the nameless poet has
spread out before us, makes an entirely characteristic
impression, by the grand, childlike simplicity with which
the association between man and nature is interpreted
and described. The whole of nature is alarmed when
Igor starts upon his unfortunate ride to the Don: the
sun is darkened, the night groans, the beasts howl in
anticipation of the impending danger. Both Yaroslávna
and Igor, on their part, address winds and streams as
if they were men; nay, give them titles and complimentary 
words just as plainly as it is done in the Iliad
two thousand years before. And the river Donyets gives
Igor an answer. The living naturalism, the transfer of
human qualities and emotions to nature, is so prominent
here that it is noticed as the expressive personal naïveté
of the characteristic poet.

Finally, the patriotism of this epic and of its author is
characteristic in the highest degree. Patriotism
permeates and constitutes its motive; a love for the
Russian land, which breaks forth not only in mourning over
the triumph of the heathen Polovtsians, but even more
vehemently in wrath and laments on account of the
discord between the Russian princes who, at the close of
this pregnant period, rent the land asunder with civil war.
When the defeat is sustained, the singer exclaims: —

“The grass bowed down in pain. The crowns of the
trees bowed down to the earth in sorrow. For the
cheerless time was already come, brothers, when it was void
of power, when injustice spread itself in the ranks of
the descendants of Dazhbog [princely power]. Quiet,
like a young girl, it stole into our land, and, as if with
the wings of a swan, dabbled in the waters of the Don
and of the blue sea. It awakened the hours of disaster.
Then the contests of the princes against the heathen
were broken off; brother said to brother, ‘This is mine,
even this also is mine.’ And the princes began to say
about small things, ‘This is great.’ But the heathens
from all sides fell down upon the Russian land.”

The old poet is a skilful battle-painter. Like the
authors of the old Northern ballads, he embellishes his
poems by descriptions of many battles which he has
seen or in which he has participated; for example : —

“The Russians fenced round the wide field with their
purple-colored shields, sought honor for themselves and
glory for their princes. At daybreak on Friday, they
crushed the heathen host of the Polovtsians under their
feet, carried the beautiful Polovtsian girls away with
them, and with them gold and veils and costly velvet
garments. With the ribbons and capes and furs and
finery of all sorts they began to build bridges over pools
and swamps. But the red standards, the white banners,
and the spears with the silver points fell to the lot of
the brave Sviatoslavitch.”

Or read the description of the battle on the following
day : —

“On the next day the blood-red light very early
heralded the dawn. Black clouds swept in from the
sea; they would cover the four suns [the four Russian
leaders of the army], and the blue lightning trembled
in them. There was heavy thunder. The arrows flew
like rain from the great Don. Then the spears were
splintered; then the swords struck against the helmets
of the Polovtsians by the river, by Kayála, near the
great Don. O Russian land! thou art still protected.
But behold the winds, Stribog’s offspring; they blow a
sea of arrows against Igor’s brave warriors. The earth
trembles; sadly flow the rivers; the field is covered
with dust; the banners rustle; the Polovtsians come
from the Don and from the sea, and from all sides
surround the Russian army; the children of the devil
beset the shrieking battle-field; still the brave Russians
enclose it with their purple-colored shields.”

But the pearl of the poem is Yaroslávna’s lamentation
and Igor’s flight.

“Listen, the voice of Yaroslávna! Like a cuckoo she
complains alone early in the morning. ‘I will fly,’
she says, ‘like a cuckoo over the Danube; will plunge
my beaver-skin sleeves in the Kayála’s stream; will dry
the prince’s bloody wounds on his stiffening limbs.’
Yaroslávna weeps early in the morning on the wall at
Putivl, and thus she speaks: ‘O wind, thou mighty
wind, why, oh, Lord! dost thou blow so hard? Why dost
thou bear Chanen’s arrows on thy light wings against my
lover’s men? Was it not enough for thee to blow the
mountain waves out from under the clouds when thou
didst rock the ships on the blue sea? Why does the
breath of thy spirit waft my joy away over the grass of
the plains?’ Yaroslávna weeps early in the morning on
the walls at Putivl, and thus she speaks: ‘O Dnieper,
the famous! thou hast broken through the rocks in the
country of the Polovtsians, hast rocked Sviatolaf’s ships
against Kobyak’s<footnote>Prince of the Polovtsians.</footnote> hosts. Lord, bring my lover back to
me, so that I no longer shall send him my tears over
the sea!’ Yaroslávna weeps on the wall at Putivl, and
thus she speaks: ‘Thou clear and thrice clear sun! thou
art warm and beautiful for all. Why dost thou aim thy
burning beams on my lover’s men? Why hast thou in
the arid desert dried their bows together in their hands?
Why hast thou tortured them with thirst, so that the
quiver became heavy on their backs?’

“Towards midnight the sea became disturbed; whirlwinds 
raised themselves among the fogs. God shows
Prince Igor a way out of the country of the Polovtsians
to the Russian land, to his father’s golden throne. The
glow of the evening is extinguished. Does Igor sleep?
No, he is awake; he measures in his mind the plains
from the great Don to the little Donyets. Listen! the
sound of his horse at midnight. Ovlur whistles on this
side of the river, gives information to the prince: Igor
must not remain longer. The earth roars, the grass
whistles, the guards of the Polovtsians draw near.
Then Igor leaps up like a weasel in the rushes; like a
white sea-duck, he leaps into the water. He jumps on
his fleet horse. Soon after he leaps down again, and,
like a wolf, with light steps he hastens to the meadows
of the Donyets; flies like a falcon in the fog, killing
geese and swans for his meals morning, noon, and night.
While Prince Igor flies like a falcon, Ovlur runs like a wolf,
both dripping with cold dew in the grass of the steppes.
For they have broken the wind of their fleet horses.

“Donyets said, ‘Prince Igor, thou shalt have no little
honor now, and Kontchak no little wrath, and the
Russian land no little joy.’ Igor answers, ‘O Donyets!
no little honor hast thou now, thou who borest the prince
on thy billows, made him a bed on the green grass on
thy banks, and covered him with warm fog in the shade
of green trees; thou who causedst him to be guarded by
the sea-duck on the water, by the gull on the rivers, by
the wild-duck in the air! Not such,’ said he, ‘is the
river Stugna, whose stream is so dangerous when it has
swallowed foreign brooks, and which has broken our barks
against the roots of the trees on its shore. Nor is the
Dnieper such a river. That thrust our young prince
Rostislav back from its sombre banks. Rostislav’s
mother now weeps over the young prince. The flowers
wither, consumed by grief; the tree bowed its crown
down to the earth in sorrow.’”<footnote>Wenceslaus Hanka: <i>Igor Svatoslavitch.</i> Prag, 1821. (Text,

From these extracts we can form a conception of the
style and tone of the Russian epic. We see that they
are very different from those of the heroic poems of the
Edda. This written epic is unique in Russian literature.
It differs from the <i>bîlinî</i> of the Kief-circle by its purely
historical character, since none of its leading actors are
demi-gods, but all the heroes who figure there are men,
who conquer or suffer in a purely human manner. In
the next place, this epic is characteristic from its stamp
of aristocratic culture, since it was evidently written
with the purpose in view, like the old Norse laudatory
poems, of being recited before the body guard of a
prince. Therefore it does not extol the masses in the
person of a popular hero, but sings of the chiefs and
leaders of the army as the leading men. Still, however
patriotic the poem is, it is nevertheless inspired by the
patriotism of the princely power and of the highest
culture.

<h2><small>II.</small></h2>

<sc>The</sc> Russian national literature, like the Danish,
dates from the eighteenth century, and it is even a
little younger than the latter. The foundation was
laid by Lomonósof, thirty years after Holberg became
the founder of ours. But between the ancient literature
written in the Church Slavic together with the <i>bîlinî</i>,
which date from a period before the reign of the Tatars,
and the modern Russian book-world there lie the popular
ballads, the short lyrical poems, Little Russian as well
as Great Russian, rich and attractive from their
tenderness and their sadness.

Little-Russian and Great-Russian popular ballads, each
written in its own dialect, sung by widely different
people, belong, in fact, to two different literatures, of which
one, in later times, by despotic command, has been
suppressed; but, in spite of the differences, the two groups
present so many points of resemblance that they
influence the mind in a cognate manner.

The Little-Russian ballads treat exclusively of the
life of the Cossack people in older and later times. The
Ukraine steppes are the theatre of this life, but the
ballads also follow the Cossack in all his bold excursions
away from home for centuries. They present picture
after picture of the dangers in the martial life on
horseback, in eternal conflicts with enemies in the east and
west. There is the mortal hour of the wounded Cossack
longing for home in a foreign land; the corpse which is
washed by the cold rain and whose eyes are picked out
by the birds of prey; the lamentation of the Cossack
girl when the signal for the departure is given, and her
lover rides away; her ardent regret for him when he is
absent on a military expedition in a foreign land; the
lamentation of the old Cossack over the young men who
have disappeared; the young Cossack’s self-reliance and
confidence in victory; the sorrow of the lovers at the
gossip about them, and the ignominy which they who
would separate them heap upon the loved girl, — all this
in short lyrical poems different from the more narrative
form of the Cossack <i>duma</i>, which is fond of describing a
definite historical person or exploit.<footnote>Comp. Fr. Bodenstedt: <i>Die poetische Ukraine, Sammlung Kleinrussischer 
Volkslieder.</i> See G. Brandes: <i>Indtryk fra Polen</i>, 220, 227.
</footnote>

The Great-Russian ballads are of several kinds: partly
being the more stereotyped wedding and Christmas
verses; partly the so-called ballads of men of adventure, 
that is, of highwaymen, — the semi-pathetic, semi-humorous, 
always humble ballads of those who are under
sentence of death, which open the perspective to the
gallows, and to that extent have a certain resemblance
to several poems of François Villon; and partly (the
great bulk) of genuine popular ballads, nearly all of
which are about the longing and sorrows of lovers.<footnote>See the poems in Wolfsohn: <i>Die schönwissenschaftliche
Litteratur der Russen</i>, 227-272.</footnote>

The Little-Russian and Great-Russian popular ballads
agree in two principal features: in the comparison
between a display of nature and a mental condition, which
is continually evoked by companionship with nature and
a poetic view thereof, and in the richness of expression
for the most varied moods and shades of a love upon
whose multifarious sorrows they dwell with ineffable
sadness.




The natural parallel is of this sort: —

Little Russian: “A hop vine alone in the garden —
hurled itself down to the earth. — A young little girl
among men — wept very bitterly. — ‘O green, blossoming
hop, say — why do you not twine?’ —  ‘Oh, dear young
girl, — why do you grieve over your fate?’” etc.

Great Russian: “Between two mountains, two high
mountains, — grew up a slim white birch tree — a slim
birch tree, a branching — where the sun warmed it not,
and the moon and the starry host shed not their light, —
where only the blasts shook it, — where only violent
torrents of rain fell upon it — so among our neighbors —
grew up a sweet little girl, — praised for her beauty and
neatness, — her slenderness and plumpness and
daintiness,” etc.

So far as richness in expressions of love is concerned,
it may be regarded as scientifically proved that, of all
living and dead languages, there is none so rich in
expression as the Russian in both of its dialects. The
philologist Carl Abel has written an essay which gives
a vivid impression of the peculiarity of the Russian
language in this respect. (“The Conception of Love in
some Ancient and Modern Languages.”) They have, for
the expression of love as a pure, simple emotion, as an
involuntary attraction, the noun <i>liubov</i> and the verb <i>liubity</i>
and the adjectives <i>liubezni, liubeni, liuboï, liub</i> (loved for
superiority, by voluntary choice, by taste, from interest);
next, <i>zaznóba</i>,<footnote>Passion, “flame.”</footnote> which indicates the growing love with its
sweet apprehensions and its tender hopes. <i>Milost</i> is
the active love in endless shades: preference, good will,
partiality, grace. <i>Blagost</i> is especially grace in all its
goodness, warmth, and inexhaustibility. The study of
languages shows that, while love among the Romans in
particular was love for the family, for kinsmen, and
regarded as a duty, among the Hebrews love for the
whole tribe, and, at the highest point, love for the whole
of mankind, and was regarded as a religion; the Russian
sentiment, according to the derivation of the words, is
caressing and full of charm, exclusively a natural instinct,
far less conscious, circumspect, and trustworthy, always
wholly involuntary.

The domain of Russian love is the tender flattery
which expresses itself in innumerable ingratiating
diminutives. Of <i>liubov</i>, love, as a woman’s name, the common
people make use of the names Liuba, Liubka, Liubkascha,
Liubaschenka, Liubashetchka, Liubotchka, Liubutchka,
Liubushenka, Liubushetchka, Liubenka, and even many
others, each with its different shade of tenderness and
caressing. And, however numerous the linguistic
expressions for the sentiments and moods of love are,
naturally just as numerous are the sentiments and
moods themselves.<footnote>See Carl Abel: Linguistic Essays, pp. 23-78.</footnote>

Here is a short erotic poem, which is typical: —

“Thou ash tree, oh, thou full of branches! — when
didst thou sprout, when didst thou grow up? — Thou
ash tree, oh, thou full of branches! — when wast thou in
blossom, and when didst thou ripen?”

“I sprouted in spring, shot up in summer — I was in
blossom in the spring, became a tree in the summer.”

“Under thee there grows, under thee, thou Ash! — no
poppy flowers and no grass, — there grows no grass, there
burns no fire. — There burns no fire, yet a heart so warm.
— Yet the heart so warm in a youth’s breast — it burns,
burns, nay, boils like pitch — boils in longing for, my
little swan — my swan, my dove, my little soul, — my
charming dove, my dearly beloved. —

“Oh, thou soul, my soul, my beautiful maid — in the
hour of daybreak, when the morning was red — when
the shining sun rose up in the heavens — without leave
of thy father and mother — without even once seeing
thy friend — thou left life, thou went away from here.—

“Oh, ye winds, ye warm winds, ye! — warm winds, ye
who waft towards autumn — blow ye not here, I need
ye not. — But come only thou storm, oh, thou roaring!
— From the regions of the North fly only thou hither! —
Split only with thy breath the moist earth — split the
wide field, split the broad field! — Oh, open for me,
storm! open for me here my grave. — And ah, let me,
let me for the last time — here take leave of my loved
friend — of my loved friend, of my dearly beloved. —
Only a tear-kiss amid weeping so bitter! — Then I expire
and die with her.”

When from these tones of nature you come to the
lyrical in the founder of the later Russian literature, the
transition is abrupt, so abrupt that for a man of the
present day it demands a very great interest in the
historical development of a great people, not to put
Lomonósof aside with disgust. For he, who, moreover, was a far
greater philosopher than poet, belongs absolutely to that
tendency of taste in the eighteenth century for which
the inartistic poetry of the people was no poetry at all,
and which saw the end and aim of lyric poetry in the
strained pathos of the style of the ode and its artistic
form of regular combination. The modern artistic poem,
in various parts of the country, begins in this eighteenth
century by separating itself as far as possible from the
ballads of the people and from everything which belongs
to them, so as for the first time at the beginning of the
new century to seek backwards for simplicity, unity,
and nature.

Lomonósof, whom Byelinski has called the “Peter the
Great of Russian literature,” was obliged to shape the
modern Russian language, as a literary language, entirely
anew. Before the time of Peter the Great they wrote
in Church Slavic, after that a mixture of Church Slavic
and Russian. As a boy, Lomonósof had drawn the
language of the people from the purest fountain, had heard
it as it fell from the lips of the Russian fishermen in
Archangel, but he had studied Slavic at an early age in
the old church books. He was thus able to mould his
language with the confidence of a man of intellect, and
created the newer prose style and the Russian metre and
wrote the first sonorous verse existing in Russian,
composed by any poet whose name is known.

Lomonósof’s importance for Russia is, as already stated,
closely akin to that of Holberg for Norway and
Denmark. He had a wonderfully many-sided genius,
developed by a career which is almost marvellous. Mikhaïl
Vasilyevitch Lomonósof was born in 1711, in a village in
the department of Archangel. His father was a royal
serf, who earned his living as a fisherman, and who used
to take the boy with him out in his boat. From his
tenth to his sixteenth year the intelligent boy thus
sailed about every summer over the White Sea and the
Arctic Ocean, receiving impressions of a great and wild
nature, experiencing the poor man’s hard fight for bread,
seeing salt-works, cloisters, religious meetings, and among
the people of the region he acquired a knowledge of the
character of the Russian people in its purity. — He
learned to read and write from the village priest, devoured
one or two old church books, which were the only reading 
available to him, discovered that Latin must be learned
in order to acquire knowledge of a wider scope, and
therefore ran away from home at the age of seventeen
and went ten miles on foot to catch a wagon-train of
frozen fish which was going from Archangel to Moscow.
There he was dropped in the market-place, and by the
accidental kindness of a monk a few days later was taken
to a cloister school, which indeed only received the sons
of the nobility, but where his ancestry was overlooked.
Here, and for a short time in Kief, his progress in Latin
and Greek, in the Slavic language, in philosophy,
physics, and mathematics, is that of a genius. “When
he had completed his courses at Moscow and Kief, he
obtained the privilege of being sent to the Academy at
St. Petersburg and to Germany, where at Marburg he
attended Chr. Wolf’s lectures on philosophy, and at
Friburg he studied practical metallurgy and mining.

He had previously made attempts at writing verse in
St. Petersburg, and now he showed his enthusiasm for
the poet Johann Christian Gunther, forgotten in our
time outside of Germany, by transferring his metres to
the Russian language. His first ode to the Tsaritsa
Anna, a memorial ode celebrating the conquest of
Chotin, is an exact imitation of a poem by Gunther
in honor of Prince Eugene. Lomonósof, perhaps,
surpasses his German model in spirit, and is possibly his
equal in the domain of the ode in bombast; but he does
not at all succeed, like Gunther, in writing bold and
audacious verses about his personal experiences or his
erotic inclinations.

In 1740 he is secretly married to the daughter of a
poor tailor in Marburg, runs in debt, and, when he is
threatened with the debtor’s prison, flies secretly from
the town without even telling his wife, and begins to
beg his way on foot with the intention of getting to
Holland. On the way he falls in with a Prussian
recruiting officer with recruits, who gets him drunk, gives
him the bounty money, and receives his promise. The
next morning Lomonósof wakes up in uniform, and, in
spite of all his prayers and protestations, is a Prussian
cavalry soldier. He is taken to the fortress at Wesel.
He deserts, hotly pursued, amid dangers and anxieties,
crossing the Westphalian boundaries, and arrives at
Amsterdam, representing himself to be a poor student from
Saxony. In Holland the Russian minister takes charge
of him, and sends him back to St. Petersburg.

From the Hague he wrote to his wife for the first
time since his flight; but in St. Petersburg, where he
did not feel that he was in a situation to support his
wife and the child she had brought to him, he allowed
two whole years to pass without any communication,
until she, through the Russian minister at the Hague,
finally learned where he was, and with his consent came
to him.

From 1745 Lomonósof labored at St. Petersburg as
professor of chemistry and experimental physics, and
from 1755 began to advocate a plan for the re-organization 
of the Scientific Society, in which he fought against
the encroachments of the Germans, hitherto the sole
masters of the situation; and, as the passionate, nay,
fanatical exponent of Russian nationality, was soon
guilty of no less scientific and personal encroachments.

Here at home he developed his whole genius as a
scientist. He was the first Russian naturalist who, on
the foundation of the scientific results of Western
Europe, which he laid before his pupils, was an
independent inventor of machines and apparatus, and an
independent discoverer of hitherto unknown laws of
nature. The great mathematician Euler gave the most
appreciative praise to his work on the phenomena of
electricity, light, and air. Euler publicly declared that
“this talented man did honor to the academy and the
whole people.” In physics, Lomonósof, independent of
Franklin, explained the principles of electricity in the
air and of the Northern Lights, which accords in many
points with Franklin’s, and in some other respects he
is even more advanced. In mineralogy he was the first
to point out the vegetable origin of amber and the
production of coal from peaty soil under the influence of
subterranean gases. In astronomy he was the discoverer 
of the atmosphere of Venus. Finally, as a chemist
and geologist, he distinguished himself by his popular
descriptive powers.

His studies in the Russian language, literature, and
history made an epoch. His Russian grammar has
controlled education in his native land for half a century.
He wrote books about Russian style, rhetoric, and metres
at the same time that he himself was working as a poet
and orator. Finally, he is Russia’s pioneer in mosaic
art. There still exist from his hand a well executed
portrait in mosaic of Peter the Great, and a large work
representing the battle at Poltava.

It is this man of genius who, for the first time since
the introduction into Russia of the intellectual and in
some directions material foreign ascendency by the Tsar
Peter, gave an organ to the old Russian national feeling,
while he at the same time made himself its poetical
exponent and its practical champion, — the latter being
carried out to the most infatuated <i>chauvinism</i>. His
great reputation in this generation, when his poetry is
no longer read, depends on the fact that it was he
who gave the first impulse towards the liberation of
the Russian intellectual life and of Russian science,
then just dawning, from the foreign and especially from
the German yoke.

When Lomonósof was admitted to the Academy of
St. Petersburg, there were two illustrious Germans,
Gerhard Müller and A. L. von Schlözer, who had laid the
foundation for all historical investigation in Russia, who
were the influential persons in the Academy, where,
moreover, they found themselves surrounded almost
exclusively by their countrymen. At the request of
the Tsar Peter, the founder of the Academy, Leibnitz,
had prepared a plan therefor, expressly designed to
“bring the culture of the west into Russia, and to be
instrumental in teaching the Russians to know and
appreciate it, and in thus causing them to cease to be
regarded as barbarians.” It was in his spirit that only
books of instruction of the Academy were printed in
Russian, while the purely scientific publications, which,
moreover, would not have found many readers if printed
in Russian, were issued in German or French. But,
naturally, this condition, when the national feeling first
grew strong, could not long continue.

In 1741, Elizabeth, by the aid of the party of the
native nobility, annulled the rule which Münnich,
Ostermann, and some other aristocrats of German
birth in the regency of Anna Leopoldovna, had
established for the minority of Iván VI. Elizabeth had
banished Münnich and Ostermann, “bravery and wisdom,”
from her empire, and was now everywhere greeted as
the person who was to bring about an age of reform in
Russia, only on account of the agitation in the direction
opposite to that which was due to her great father.
She had inherited Peter’s sensuous instincts, but not
his genius. In the mean time, simply that she dreamed
about again making Moscow the capital of the empire,
that she had only native-born Russians about her and
continually took the part of protectress of the orthodox
clergy, who had long been repressed, was enough to make
her generally regarded as the liberator of the people
from the oppression of Western Europe. She was
especially so regarded by Lomonósof, whose lyrical poems
have hardly any other subject than his sovereign; and
she was celebrated as “the Astræa who had brought back
a golden age,” “the Moses who had brought Russia out
of the darkness of Egyptian thraldom,” etc. Under
her guidance, Russia was to show that, without foreign
teachers, it was in a situation to bring forward
“profound Platos and intellectually endowed Newtons” — a
manner of speech which sounds strangely in the mouth
of Lomonósof, who had himself been so thoroughly
grounded in the schools of foreign lands, and who,
without the instruction in Marburg and Friburg, never
would have attained the level of the European culture of
his day.

His general enthusiasm for science was beyond all
doubt, but in the domain of history and language the
rabid national feeling handicapped him as to the results
within reach. In his contests Avith Müller and Schlözer
he maintains, for example, that they derived the
Russian word <i>kniaz</i> (prince) from the German word <i>knecht</i>
to dishonor the Russian people and stamp them as a
nation of thralls. (<i>Kniaz</i> seems to be cognate not only
to the word <i>knecht</i>, but also to the English word <i>knight</i>,
and other appellations of rank of the highest repute.
Nevertheless, the comparison, by Anatole Leroy
Beaulieu, of <i>kniaz</i> with <i>king</i> [<i>La Russie</i>, i. 214] is certainly
misleading.) An address of Müller, which was to be
delivered on the name-day of the Tsaritsa, “About the
Scandinavian Origin of the Russian Race and Name,”
struck Lomonósof as insulting to the honor and prestige
of the Russian people. He was so reckless in his 
passion that one day he burst into the audience-room of the
German professor, and began to scold and abuse him.
When he was summoned before the consistory in regard
to it, he fell upon his associates with such abusive terms
that they refused to place them upon the record. He
was condemned to be punished with the knout for this,
but, “out of consideration for his services as a scholar,
and his superior intellectual qualities,” the sentence was
commuted to a reduction of his salary.

At this time it became established as an article of
faith that the intention of Peter the Great had been to
drive foreign culture out of the land as soon as it had
done its work; and as they now contended that its
mission was already accomplished, they succeeded in
being able to honor Peter also among the great national
rulers. Lomonósof, therefore, compares him in his
speeches with God himself. To the speaker’s servility
to Elizabeth, one of whose favorites he was, there is
naturally even less limit.

Lomonósof’s lyrical poems were at first didactic, like
the antiquated, naïve “About the Use of Glass,” which,
on account of the insight of the author into the natural
sciences, stands a little above the didactic poems of this
kind of the eighteenth century, and rather reminds us
of the cognate poems of Hans Christian Oersted. In
the next place he wrote religious poems, observations on
the greatness of God and on similar themes, in the same
style as Johannes Ewald among us, and finally hymns
in laudation of Elizabeth and her husband, which remind
us in the highest degree of the flights in the first ode
of Victor Hugo in <i>Odes et Ballades</i>.<footnote>About Lomonósof, see Wolfsohn, above cited, 305-340, with
excellent metrical translations; Reinholdt, above cited, 304 and
following, with translations by Bellinghausen; and the anonymous work,

die Akademie der Wissenschaften</i>, pp. 194-245.</footnote>



The strongest impression which the foreigner receives
of this great figure, planted at the entrance to Russian
literature, is its typical Russian stamp. We notice,
in the next place, its quality of appropriating the
results of a foreign civilization, with such remarkable 
rapidity and in so many different directions, and
how the imitative tendency has taken root and become
productive. We remark the universality which reminds
us of Peter the Great, and which, as in the case of the
latter, takes its starting-point in mechanics and technics.
Lomonósof is a real <i>muzhik</i>, the ingenious serf who,
in the space of one generation, goes through the
development which we trace back to the natural gifts of the
Russian peasant in the main, but which his class of
society as a whole will take a thousand years to travel
through. Lomonósof is a genuine Slav by nature,
flighty and gentle. Several years in succession he
vanishes from his wife’s range of vision without sending
a word to her; but when she reminds him of her existence 
and of his child, he bursts into tears, and exclaims
to the man who brings him the letter, “My God! how
could I have left her! Circumstances have prevented
me from calling her to me. Now I will send her a
hundred rubles for the journey.” Like a genuine Slav, he
is above everything else, at the same time, a rationalist
and mystic. On his journey back to Russia he had seen
in a dream his father’s corpse cast up by the waves
on an uninhabited island in the Arctic Ocean. The
strong mathematician could not escape from this vision.
He had scarcely reached home before he inquired of
people from Archangel about his father’s fate, and learned
that now for four months after he had gone out a-fishing
on the Arctic Ocean, nothing had been heard from him.
He then sent his brother with a letter to the fishermen
of the region, and directed them to seek for his father’s
body on the island seen in his dreams, whose situation
he exactly described; and, since the body was found,
was for the rest of his life obstinately convinced that
it was found exactly on the spot shown to him in his
dream.

Finally Lomonósof is Russian in his rambling propensity, 
and his thirst for foreign knowledge; very Russian
in his adoration of the Tsaritsa; Russian in his
coarseness and violence towards his foreign colleagues; but
Russian especially in the way in which, a pupil of the
Germans, he goes <i>to the end of his rope</i> in his hatred
of and opposition to the intellectual sway of the
foreigner.

From Lomonósof it is a direct descent through Derzhavin 
and Zhukovski down to Pushkin and Lermontof,
the literary geniuses of this century.

Derzhavin (1743-1816) represents in lyrics the period
of Catherine II., as Lomonósof does that of Elizabeth.
He was born at Kazán, learned German early, read
Gellert and Hagedorn, Herder and Klopstock, was
compelled to pass twelve hard years from 1762 as a soldier of
the guard. The day when Catherine ascended the throne,
he stood as a soldier of nineteen on guard at the Winter
Palace. No one could then have imagined that in the
future his name would be mentioned in connection with
hers.

In 1773 he took part in the campaign against Pugatchef 
on the Volga, which he afterwards tried to describe
in verse. In 1777 he published his first collection of
poems, which contained among others a translation of a
number of the poems of Frederick the Great. He obtained 
a civil appointment by his well-known “Ode to
Feliza, Tsaritsa of the Kirgiz-Cossacks” (viz., Catherine).
He attracted the attention of the Tsaritsa, received a
snuff-box and some ducats for his poem, and then one
important office after the other, since on account of his
passionate, fiery temperament, which was strangely united
with the most methodical pedantry, he was generally
very soon obliged to leave his posts. His ode on the
occasion of the taking of Izmail by storm inspired Catherine
anew just when his affairs were at a low ebb. In 1791 he
was appointed private secretary to the Tsaritsa, but tired
her excessively in this capacity. Under Paul he became
the leading officer in the home department of the empire,
and under Alexander minister of justice, without being
of any use in either of these offices. He was obliged
to leave the former on account of “licentious language;”
in the latter he showed himself to be ultra-reactionary,
and, among other things, set himself with might and
main against the plan, which had even then been
proposed, of emancipating the serfs. Derzhavin had some
other traits as an official; he was disagreeable and
pedantic, and at the same time possessed a vigorous
conscience, a combination which reminds a Dane of
Schack Staffeldt.

He passed that part of his life which fell to the
nineteenth century almost wholly as a private man,
surrounded by the admiration and piety of the rising
literary generation. His figure inspired veneration, his
eye was full of fire, and the expression of his
countenance was mild. When, a year before his death, he was
present at the final examination of a grammar school in
Tsarskoye-Sielo, a pupil recited a poem composed by
himself. This pupil was Alexander Pushkin, and his
verses made such an impression on the old poet, that,
after having heard them, he exclaimed: “My time is
past — you will now be a second Derzhavin.” Pushkin,
in his <i>Yevgeni Onyégin</i> (viii. 2), recalls, with emotion,
these encouraging words which his predecessor in the
poetic art gave him by the way.

Derzhavin began as the imitator of Lomonósof’s
bombastic style with the broad, cold pathos. His ode
“God,” admired and celebrated in its time, corresponds
to the import of the religious odes of Baggesen in the
Danish literature. It must be owing to the subject that
the poem has been translated into a great many different
tongues, and last of all into the Japanese. It contains
everything which such a hymn must contain of gratitude
and humility, on the part of the very small towards the
eternal greatness, but no genuine emotion and not an
idea. The long-winded poem which won Catherine’s
favor is far better. It surprises us agreeably on coming
from the Klopstock bombast of earlier days. It keeps
to the earth, is jocular and sportive, adopts a tone like
that which Horace assumed towards Mæcenas, in the
broad description of the worldly-minded laziness of the
poet in comparison with the life full of responsibility
of the regent. The poem “The Great” has no longer
any poetic, but a historic and psychological interest,
because, without mentioning any names, it contains a
disparaging description of Potemkin (pronounced Patyómkin) 
in contrast to other unappreciated but really great
Russians. Our respect for the poet is, however,
somewhat diminished, from the fact that he himself was
indebted to Potemkin’s energetic protection for his escape
in a lawsuit brought against him by some bitter enemies,
so that gratitude ought to have restrained him from
giving utterance to his ill humor. He also, at a later period,
commemorated Potemkin’s solitary death in the middle
of the steppes in his poem “The Waterfall.”

Constantly changing influences from Western and
Southern Europe, from the contemporary age and from
the past, had their effect upon this poetry, which just
escaped mediocrity. The influence of Horace and the
Anacreontics, perhaps through the influence of the
Göttingen lyric, follows that of Klopstock. When
the ballad style prevails, Derzhavin begins to write
ballads and to imitate, at second-hand (after Zhukovski),
Bürger’s “Leonore.” At the close of his poetic career
he was influenced by Ossian, who was then making an
impression everywhere.

The influence which Ludwig Holberg exerted even
here in distant Russia at this period is specially
interesting to a Dane. The author who laid the foundation
of Russian comedy, Denis von Wízin (1742-1792),
received the impulse to his dramatic attempts from
Holberg. French and German companies had found an
audience in Russia before the Russian theatre was
established, and it was a German manager, the distinguished
actor Ackerman, who, so to speak, introduced the entire
comedy of Holberg into Russia. When a permanent
Russian stage was opened in St. Petersburg and Moscow
(1756-57), a long list of plays of the favorite Danish
author, translated from the German into Russian, was
produced upon it. “Don Ranudo” and “Henry and
Pernilla” gave the most satisfaction, yet they could not
compete in power of attraction with the lyrical tragedy
of Metastasio, “Artaxerxes,” translated by Holberg,
which was regarded as an original production of Holberg
and always filled the house to the last place.

Von Wízin saw “Henry and Pernilla” in St. Petersburg 
when he was a student, and felt, to use his own
expression, “an indescribable fascination” in this
comedy. His first celebrated comedy, “The 
Brigadier-General,” is greatly influenced by Holberg, especially
by “Jean de France.” The General’s son Ivan (that is,
Jean), who has been educated in a boarding-house of a
French coachman, has returned from his journey to
Paris with the “Francomania.” How great the resemblance 
is between this figure and the Hans Frandsen of
Holberg, a brief extract will make plain.

<i>The General:</i> “Listen, Ivan, I have seldom blushed
since I got out of leading-strings; but to-day, in spite of
my gray hair, I was so ashamed of you that my cheeks
burned.”

<i>Ivan:</i> “<i>Mon cher père!</i> Can it be agreeable to me to
be told that I must marry a Russian girl?”

<i>The General:</i> “Are you a Frenchman, then? I
thought you were born in Russia.”

<i>Iván:</i> “My body was born in Russia; that is true.
But my spirit belongs to the French crown.”

<i>The General:</i> “Then you owe Russia more than
France, for there is more coherence in your body than
there is in your spirit.”

<i>Iván:</i> “See here, papa, now you are beginning to say
civil things to me, since you understand that you cannot
make any progress by severity.”

<i>The General:</i> “You are a regular fool! I have called
you a blockhead, and you think that I am paying you
compliments. What an ass!”

<i>Iván:</i> “Ass! <i>Il ne me flatte pas.</i> — I repeat to you,
papa, <i>je vous le répète</i>, that my ears are not accustomed
to such expressions.”

It is no slight honor for Denmark that the man who
laid the foundation of our national literature and
created the Danish stage has also been instrumental
in the foundation of the Russian theatre. He died
without seeing anything of this; he certainly never
suspected how large a portion of the world his genius
would affect; but it is a curious idea that even in the
last years of Holberg’s life, when his countrymen were
turning their backs upon him, the inhabitants of St.
Petersburg and Moscow were jubilant over his comedies,
and that only ten years after his death his influence
could be traced as predominant in the first Russian
comedies that gave any pleasure to their hearers.<footnote>See Alexis Wesselofsky: <i>Deutsche Einflüsse auf das alte
Russische Theater, von</i> 1672-1758, p. 107. Reinholdt, cited above, p. 358
and following.</footnote>

Von Wízin, “the Russian Moliere,” was also influenced
by several other foreign authors besides Holberg. But,
upon the whole, down to the present time, it has been a
law of Russian literature and intellectual life that no
progress and no new form of development has been
attained except on a foundation of foreign influence in
its most emphatic and unequivocal form.

This is again to be seen in the author who shows the
next advance, and who, in Russia, is regarded as the
Columbus of romanticism; namely, Vasíly Zhukovski
(1783-1852). A man of subtile talent; a character
tender as a woman, but pure, with A. W. Schlegel’s gifts as
a translator, but without Schlegel’s wealth of ideas, —
an honest visionary and upright lover of the good, the
beautiful, and the true, as three venerable, conservative
powers, well fitted to develop as court poet under the
Tsar Nicholas, and to end, as Slavic men of talent like
to end, in mystic pietism. He is the author of the
Russian national song, the hymn to the Tsar.

Zhukovski was the illegitimate son of an elderly Russian
country nobleman by the name of Bunin and a young
Turkish woman whom Bunin had brought home to his residence
as booty after the conquest of Bender. The boy grew
up with Bunin’s legitimate daughters, who were much
older; early developed, and spoiled in a purely feminine
atmosphere. While yet young, he read Diderot, Voltaire,
Young, Büger, Herder, Wieland, and Schiller. At the
age of nineteen, he translated Schiller’s “William Tell;”
some years later, “Don Quixote;” also wrote original
epic poems, ballads, and tales, yet without close
connection with the Russian popular spirit, because, in almost
every one of his poems, youcan point out the foreign
models.

In 1812 he participated with distinction, as an officer,
in the campaign against the army of Napoleon, and
became celebrated by the poem, “The Singer in the
Russian Camp,” and by a metrical homage addressed
to the Tsar Alexander from Paris, which for the first
time brought him in contact with the ladies of the
imperial family. He suffered the heartache of youth when
some one, on grounds of orthodoxy, refused to give him
his niece in marriage. In order to enjoy the young girl’s
society, he accompanied the family to Dorpat, passed an
instructive year in the little university town, and then,
in 1816, in St. Petersburg, joined the literary society
“Artasamas,” composed of persons similarly educated,
of which Pushkin, Nicholas Turgenief, and the later
re-actionists, Minister Bludof and Uvarof, were
members; a society which, as a league of the Phosphorists
in Sweden of that time, started the opposition of the
new century against the French classicism.

The romanticism which the society advocated as an
offset did not and could not have that relation to the
past, especially to the Middle Ages, possessed by the
German romanticism, of which it was a product. For
the Russian antiquity and Middle Ages were, at that
time, still a sealed book. They only brought forward
a new and, in its essence, a tolerably inexact æsthetic
doctrine: fantasy should have freer flight than before;
deeper psychological insight is of more account than
local color. Still, like all other nationalities during the
reign of Napoleon and after his fall, the Russian nation
turned its attention to its national peculiarity, and the
problem of describing the nature of the Russian land and
people, and of representing the domestic world in poetry,
was now presented for the first time, and for the first
time solved by Pushkin in his way. Here, as everywhere
else, Shakespeare made his influence felt on the nascent
romanticism, and here, as in Poland, Byron soon became
the poet of the romancing youth.

The little circle of romanticists was broken as soon
as the political question entered it. On account of his
liberal tendencies, Pushkin was sent for a six years’
exile to Southern Russia. Bludof became a legation
attaché. Zhukovski, after 1817, became a courtier,
because he was commissioned to supervise the instruction
in the Russian language and literature of Alexandra,
the German-born wife of the Prince Imperial Nicholas.
Very soon also the Tsaritsa Elizabeth, the somewhat
neglected, sentimental, and fragile consort of the Tsar
Alexander, became interested in the gentle, bland poet,
and dipped alternately into his elegies and into Tiedge’s
“Urania.” From this time Zhukovski assumed a position 
which for Hans Christian Andersen would have
been the realization of the ideal of happiness. He read
aloud with never-failing applause his ballads and odes,
his poems on grand birthdays and on the occasion of
the birth of little princes and princesses of the royal
family, in a circle of ladies of the family of the Tsar
and of the court, whose real life he neither understood
nor wished to understand, but who to him were 
supernatural beings, — “angels,” “guiding stars,” as he called
them in his festal poems.

As he had already translated a number of notable
European poems, among them Gray’s “Elegy in a
Country Churchyard,” existing in all languages, and Bürger’s
“Leonore” (Liudmila), he now displayed to this circle
of hearers an incredible productiveness as a translator:
a large number of the poems of Goethe and Schiller,
whole plays of the latter, like <i>Die Jungfrau von Orleans</i>,
Byron’s “Prisoner of Chillon,” Moore’s “Lalla Rookh,”
the Indian poem, “Nal and Damasjanti,” Fouqué’s
“Undine,” and Hebel’s Allemanic poems, Homer’s
“Odyssey,” and Rückert’s “Rusten and Sohrab,” — all
these different kinds of poetry with his subtile talent
he transmuted into flowing Russian verse.

In 1821, on a journey to Germany, he contracted a
friendship with Justinus Körner, whom he resembled
in superstitious mysticism, and made a visit to Goethe,
but without winning any favor from the old man. He
was more agreeable to “the romanticist on the throne,”
Frederick William IV., who introduced him to Tieck,
and also to other leaders of the German romanticism.
Some years after his return to Russia, a re-action towards
all the youthful desires of Alexander I. for an
enlightened despotism in the aid of progress ascended the
throne in the person of Nicholas. Soon the tender
Zhukovski, with painful astonishment, saw the best of
the friends of his youth banished; others, less
prominent, but still strong characters, leave the vicinity of
the court, and isolate themselves in obscure silence on
their estates. Nevertheless, when at this time a genius
of Pushkin’s rank turned around and extolled the
victories of Nicholas over unhappy Poland, it will not
astonish any one that Zhukovski issued from this crisis
with firm faith that whatever the Tsar regarded as right
is right.

After Pushkin’s early death (1837), Zhukovski
occupied the position of Russia’s leading poet, distinguished
at the imperial court in every manner, even appointed
as the civil tutor of the Prince Imperial Alexander
(afterwards Alexander II.). If he is now remembered
with gratitude in Russia, it is, significantly enough,
more on account of the humane influence he exerted on
the young prince, who was admirably endowed by nature,
than on account of his literary services. He dared to
put in a word for many a political offender, whom a man
who was not in so good standing or less courageous would
never have dared to name, and he thereby accomplished
a great deal of good. We see from Alexander Herzen’s
“Reminiscences,” that he procured a considerable
diminution of the burdens of exile for this great man, who as
a youth was languishing in Viatka.<footnote><i>Le Monde Russe et la Révolution. Mémoires de A. Hertzen</i>, ii.
154.</footnote> When Zhukovski,
after 1840, took up his residence in Germany, where at
the age of fifty-seven he married a girl of nineteen, who
worshipped his talent, he had the affliction of finding
out how the rule of his dear native country was hated
and despised by all thinking men in the foreign land.
The intellectual agitations of young Germany, and still
more the revolution of 1848, shook him fearfully, and
gave him the most melancholy pietism in all its force.
He lived in Frankfort for some time in company writh
Gogol, in whom the re-action had already been accomplished 
which converted him from the wittiest and most
caustic mocker of the Russian situation to a poor, sick
admirer of absolute power and a mystic obscurantist,
who lay for whole days prostrate before shrines. The
two men constantly filled each other more and more with
universal hatred of liberty and the personal feeling of
their boundless sinfulness. They both ended as insane
mystics.<footnote><i>Aus der Petersburger Gesellschaft. Neue Folge</i>, p. 106 and
following: <i>Litteratur und Presse unter dem Kaiser Nikolaus</i>.</footnote>

Zhukovski’s life spans the whole of that of the epoch-making 
Russian national poet. He prepares the way for
Pushkin, becomes his friend, and ascends his vacant
throne without being able to cause his predecessor to
be forgotten. Zhukovski was sixteen years older than
Pushkin, whom he survives for fifteen years. His
importance vanishes by the side of the younger man, who
began life as his and Derzhavin’s imitator.

<h2><small>III.</small></h2>

<sc>With</sc> Alexander Sergeyevitch Pushkin, Russian
poetry becomes an independent power, just as it is with
Goethe, Oelenschläger, or Victor Hugo. It no longer does
duty for inculcating noble emotions or useful
instruction; it is — in principle, at least — the handmaid neither
of morals nor of patriotism. It stands erect, wild, and
free.

Like the other leading Slavic poets of this period,
Pushkin was greatly influenced by Byron, and had to go
through this experience in order to become himself. He
is very peculiar from the beginning from his violent
temperament. He descends, on his mother’s side, from the
negro Hannibal, whom Peter the Great bought and
educated in France as a civil engineer, and who died with
the rank of general, possessing a good landed estate.
The face of the author as well as his poetry plainly
betrays the African blood in his veins. His father was
a man of the world, educated in France, who had never
spoken any other language than French, and who, in the
fashion of the aristocracy, also caused his son to learn
that language. Pushkin was indebted to his nurse alone,
a good Russian peasant woman, for his early and so
fruitful acquaintance with popular ballads, <i>bîlinî</i>, and fairy
tales of Russia.

Precocious, dissolute at an early age, and then and for
a long time a “dandy,” he belongs to the not small
number of artistic geniuses from the beginning of the 
century, whom an inner power, which no depravity destroys,
preserved sound and capable of production in
circumstances which would undermine and shatter weaker
minds. What harm he suffered in his soul did not
come from the wildness and irregularity in his life, but
from the pressure of the political situation when his
character was not developed, and even from the personal
attempts of the Tsar Nicholas to win him, which the
young aristocrat could not resist.

When he was only ten years old, Pushkin had devoured
his father’s French library, including Voltaire, Rousseau,
and the Encyclopedists. From his twelfth to his
eighteenth year, he went to the imperial school in
Tsarskoye-Sielo, where the instruction and spirit were French — even
the French language was taught to the pupils by Marat’s
own brother — where the instruction was very bad, and
where the older students saw their ideals in the
lieutenants of the Guard in the garrison, after whose example
they kept mistresses, gambled, and played mad pranks.
The young Pushkin was regarded as one of the worst
madcaps of the school, but at the same time enjoyed a certain
reputation for erotic and epigrammatic verses. In 1817
he got a position in the office of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, which he neglected, and plunged headlong into
the whirlpool of St. Petersburg social life, apparently
desiring no other honor than that of being a fully
developed man of the world and aristocratic lion. How much
importance, almost to his last days, he attached to the
refinements of foppery is best seen in the description which
he has given of himself under the name of Tcharsky,
in his posthumous novel, “The Egyptian Nights.” Like
Byron, he did not wish in any manner to be regarded as
a poet “by trade,” very reluctantly spoke of literature,
and, on the other hand, with great pleasure of horses,
cards, and dinners, “although he could not tell a
mountain horse from the Arabian, never remembered what
was trumps, and, at heart, preferred fried potatoes to all
the dishes of the French cook” (“Egyptian Nights”).

In spite of all his dissipations, in 1820 he published
his first poem, “Ruslan and Liudmila,” which made
an unusual sensation, although this fairy tale in verse,
founded on a Russian legend, reminds one of Ariosto, of
Wieland, and of Zhukovski, and has no other originality
than that which depends on great skill in story-telling
and careful composition. The poem passed for pure
romance; it was interesting from a certain archness
in its tone and a strong sensuousness in its color, but
was otherwise without any psychological interest.

At this time, Pushkin fell into disgrace for the first
time. As a young man, he had been a political revolutionary 
poet. An ode written by him, “To the Dagger,”
was sung in all the garrision towns of Russia, but
probably without knowledge of the author’s name. He
detested the despotism which they were compelled to
endure at the close of the reign of Alexander I., hated
the idiotic censorship, which then weighed heavily upon
poetry, and the rough rule of the police, to whose
arbitrariness the young men beheld their welfare intrusted;
and, witty as he was and with cutting sarcasm, he pierced
the ruling persons and prevailing conditions with
epigrams which circulated through the land. In 1820
the Governor-General of St. Petersburg complained of
him to the Tsar for an “Ode to Freedom;” but
Alexander read it without indignation, and only asked the
young poet to let all his other manuscripts be laid
before him. Unfortunately, among them there was a
lampoon of the Tsar’s favorite, Arakcheyef; and,
indignant at this scornful treatment of a man whom he had
treated with distinguished consideration, Alexander exiled
the sinner first to Siberia, and then, on the intercession
of many, to Kishenef in Southern Russia, as assistant
secretary of the general-governor there. During his
sojourn here, after an illness, Pushkin obtained leave to
visit the Caucasus and the Crimea. The epoch-making
impression of its natural scenery is plainly visible in
his poetry. In the Caucasus, he became acquainted with
Byron’s poetry, and the impression of it became fused in
his youthful mind with the impressions of the Caucasus,
and the Byronic impression was even the more radical of
the two. In Kishenef and Odessa, he gave offence by
his wild life and his Byronic manners, and was already
in bad odor with his superiors, when a private letter
from him to St. Petersburg was intercepted, which
described a young Englishman, a friend of Shelley’s,
with whom he had become acquainted, and in which he
defended Shelley’s so-called atheism. The result was a
new exile. Pushkin was directed, under the supervision
of the police, to reside on his estate Mikhaïlovskoye, in
the department of Pskof.

As is well known, the six years’ exile from St.
Petersburg saved Pushkin’s life. He would, no doubt, have
taken part in the revolt of December, 1825, on the
accession of Nicholas to the throne, if he had been on the
spot. After the fearful result of the revolution and the
annihilation of his nearest friends, when he resolved to
petition the Tsar for the termination of his exile, he
nevertheless humbled himself no more than to admit, in
answer to the direct question of the Tsar, that his
sympathies, on the 25th of December, had been on the side
of the rebels. Among the few points of the Russian
literary history which have become public property is the
poet’s promise of future loyalty to the Tsar, the embrace
with which the Tsar responded to the pledge, and his
own promise to Pushkin that he would protect him from
the stupidity and chicanery of the censorship by being
himself his censor in the future. Pushkin, who was
confronted with the choice between reconciliation with the
Tsar and his system or a lifelong persecution and exile,
had not the strength of character that would have made
compromise impossible.

His position in society as well as in the literary world
was soon assured. The Tsar gave him a pension of six
thousand rubles a year, with the task, which bore lightly
on the poet, of writing the history of Peter the Great,
and, at the same time, appointed him gentleman of the
imperial bed-chamber. This appointment was regarded
as very slight honor by the poet, who thought the title
absurd and degrading for a man of his importance and
reputation. He took part anew with <i>brio</i> in the “high
life” of St. Petersburg, but was, in fact, secretly and
heartily ashamed of the court favor he enjoyed while
the friends of his youth were languishing in the
casemates of fortresses and in Siberian mines, or living in
exile in foreign capitals.

He stupefied this sentiment by taking refuge in the
feeling of pride at the extent of Russia and its strength
as a military power, which is not uncommon among
eminent Russians. The former radical enjoyed the
presentation of the Russian power of beating down resistance of
every kind which came from the Poles, who had rebelled
from their longing for independence, or from the nations
of the West who sympathized with them in their love
for freedom. It is thus that his “Ode to the Slanderer
of Russia,” written in 1831, must be understood.

However, he was too unlike his worldly-minded associates, 
among whom he was placed, too thoroughly 
original, too peculiar, proud, and sarcastic, too much admired
and appreciated by those who understood his genius, not
to live environed by irritated envy and hate. It was
this hate which gratified itself by defending the
advances of the Franco-Dutch adventurer Dantés de
Hecheren to his wife, and which thus drove Pushkin to an
early death. The outburst of anger was, therefore,
justifiable, with which the younger generation in Russia,
through the voice of Lermontof, greeted the tidings of
Pushkin’s death in the well-known duel.

Pushkin is the first modern person in Russian poetry;
or, as it could also be expressed, the first illustrious man
in Russia who had the courage to express his personality
fully in poetry. In contrast to his predecessors, he at
once makes his appearance while a youth, asserting
himself without respect for tradition and authority in
literature, and he has, even when young, the stamp of
greatness on his forehead, style and power in his aspect
as a poet, which compel his contemporaries to greet him
as a chief. There is something manly about him, which
even his opponents do not fail to recognize. He belongs
to the number of those who are vituperated, assailed,
envied, and hated, but whom no one puts in the second
rank. The combination of power and grace in his
language surpassed, in a very high degree, anything that
had been known before.

To a foreigner, much of his poetry now seems
antiquated. The overwhelming influence of Byron, under
which he ripened, can be seen too plainly in his shorter
epic poems. Of the four which he wrote between 1821 and
1824, “The Prisoner in the Caucasus,” “The Fountain in
Bakhchisarai,” “The Brigand-Brothers,” and “The
Gypsies,” the first is the most pleasing from its pictures of
nature, the next two from a genuineness in the poet’s personal
emotions, which is not affected by the close imitation of
Byron's “Giaour,” “The Prisoner of Chillon,” and “The
Corsair.” Pushkin’s brigands certainly do not feel at all
like real brigands, but he has naïvely allowed his
emotional life to find free expression through them. “The
Gypsies” stands the highest. The fresh wildness with
which the figure of the gypsy girl appears makes a very
strong impression in comparison with the lack of moral
force in Alyeko, who flies from civilization and brings
one of its most disgusting vices with him: jealousy
which regards another being whom it has once loved as
its own property. Probably, this fine poem has given
Prosper Mérimée, who has translated it, the idea of his
masterpiece, “Carmen.”

Like the Prisoner in the Caucasus, Alyeko suffers from
the Byronic spleen and scepticism. The poem “Count
Nulin,” which assumes a lighter, more frivolous tone,
again reminds us of Byron, especially of “Beppo.” In
1823, Pushkin, entirely under the influence of the
English poet’s “Don Juan,” began his chief work, “Yevgeni
Onyégin,” without any plan; and to it he constantly
returned for seven years, in order to express there a
constantly more characteristic poetical delineation of
himself, and, above all, a far more complete
autobiography than is found in his other poems. Finally, his
great epic poem, “Poltava,” is evidently inspired by
Byron’s “Mazeppa,” although, regarded in and of itself,
it far surpasses the youthful poem of Byron in its
power of picturesque description, and in the historically
correct representation of the appalling character of the
old hetman, which forms a striking contrast to the
romantic stamp Byron has given to the figure.

With the exception of short lyrical poems and prose
novels, in which Pushkin stands independent, hardly a
poem of his can be named for which he did not have
a model. His tales in verse in the popular style, like
the “Song of Oleg” (pronounced <i>Aleeokh</i>) and his
fairytales are modernized <i>bîlinî</i>. Pushkin was one of the
first in Russia who made collections from the epic songs
of the people. His only great drama, “Borís Gudunóf,”
treated in such a masterly manner as to give great
promise, is an imitation of Shakespeare’s historical plays,
especially of Richard III. and Macbeth. That this play
is widely celebrated and greatly admired, while Prosper
Mérimée’s <i>Les debuts d'un Aventurier</i>, which with
infinitely more originality and truth treats the same theme,
the rebellion of the false Dmitri, is almost wholly
unknown, shows with how little justice literary fame is
often awarded. Finally, so far as Pushkin’s ballads
are concerned, they are not only strongly inspired by
Mickiewicz, but two of the best known and most
frequently translated, “The Three Budrysses” and
“Voyevods,” are verbal translations from the Polish poet,
without expressly naming the latter. It may possibly
have been stated in some of the earlier editions of
Pushkin’s works, but in the edition for the people it is
not mentioned, and in Bodenstedt’s translation of 1855
the ballads are treated as Pushkin’s, as a matter of
course.

Necessarily a vigorous independence permeates the
best, of these metrical works, and even more the prose
novels in which Pushkin took up and developed the
Russian prose style created by the great historian
Karamzín. In so far as Pushkin, himself sick, attains the
high point of presenting the healthy, he possesses, in
an extraordinary degree, the characteristic of a great
artist. The artist is generally an outlaw, a living
irregularity, a watch which goes now too fast and now too
slow, — this may even be said of Shakespeare and Molière,
— but his surprising quality therefore is that the
product is healthy, obedient to law, a watch which goes right.
So it is with Pushkin. As a man, he was only in too
high a degree a child of the St. Petersburg civilization,
a victim of society culture, a slave of fashion. As a
poet, the more he is developed, constantly the more
plainly does he show the nascent Slavic re-action against
St. Petersburg and the hatred of all society culture; as
well as of the foolish dominion of fashion which forms
the fundamental passion in “Yevgeni Onyégin,” and
which has its clearest expression when Onyégin kills
his best friend, the young Lensky, in a duel demanded
by the conventionalities of society.

Intellectually Pushkin is far behind Byron, in whom
no satiety exhausts the glowing enthusiasm for freedom,
which was his life, and which led him to death, while
Pushkin’s youthful faith in freedom, when he came to
man’s estate, surrendered to a brutal patriotism. But
he surpasses Byron in his ability to draw figures. His
fine historical tale, “The Captain’s Daughter,” is the
precursor of Gogol’s “Taras Bulba;” and his admirable
novels pave the way for the realistic representations of
the coming generation in what is called by a Russian
critic “the sentimental, naturalistic style.”

How much nearer to my heart is Pushkin’s successor,
Mikhaïl Yuryevitch Lermontof! How much deeper,
more intensively, does he act on a receptive mind!
Never shall I forget the impression his “Hero of Our
Time,” in Marmier’s French translation, made upon me
as a schoolboy. It was Byronism in its strongest, most
delicate essence, the greatness in this Caucasus to which
Lermontof was again and again banished, — greatness
in nature, greatness and frigidity in the hero’s soul. It
was the Prometheus of the newer time, chained to the
rocks of the Caucasus. It was courage, modesty, thirst
for pleasure, feeling of superiority, bound up in
banishment, tortured by the eagle’s beak of a world-weary
passion for scepticism.<footnote>Comp. Geo. Brandes: <i>Soeren Kierkegaard</i>, p. 120.</footnote> How I loved and admired this
book, the first which I understood as a grown-up man!
How I sympathized with the poor Tscherkesserine
Bela, with the passionate and morbid Viera, and with
the little Princess Mary, all those women who love
the hard and proud Petchórin; and, in the next place,
with the good old Captain Maxim Maximitch, whose
admiring attachment Petchorin rewards with corresponding 
coldness! And in the preface to the book, the
admirable poem contributed by Marmier, which is so
descriptive of Lermontof.

<poem>“Je te rends grâces, O Seigneur!
Du tableau varié d’un monde plein de charmes,
Du feu des passions et du vide du cœur,
Du poison des baisers, de l’âcreté des larmes,
De la haine qui tue et de 1’amour qui ment,
De nos rêves trompeurs perdus dans les espaces,
De tout, enfin, Mon Dieu! Puisé-je seulement
Ne pas longtemps te rendre grâces!”</poem>

Bodenstedt has given a description of Lermontof as
he saw him, the winter before his death, in a restaurant
in Moscow: “A young officer of middle height, with a
stately, unconstrained demeanor, and unusual elasticity
in all his movements. He had his neckcloth carelessly
tied about the neck, his uniform was not wholly buttoned
up nor wholly new, but under it dazzling white linen
could be seen.” He stooped down to pick up something
which he had dropped, says Bodenstedt, “with a 

suppleness as if all the bones in his body were broken, although
from his breast and shoulders you would conclude that
he had a reasonably strong frame.” And he describes
the contrast between the great, sedate, expressive eye,
and the mocking expression about the finely cut mouth,
paints his cynicism in the use of language, his pleasure
in showing himself superior to those present, and his
sincere desire for reconciliation when he had offended
any one.

What we admire in this description is that it not
only vividly recalls Lermontof’s own description of the
“Hero of our Time,” but that every single expression
and turn corresponds to the place where Petchórin
is introduced in the section, Maxim Maximitch. It
reads thus: “He was of middle height, elegant and
delicate; but his broad shoulders augured a strong frame,
and, when you observed, you readily saw that nature
had furnished him with power to endure the toils of a
roving life, the influences of varied climates, the
whirlwinds of life in the world, and the storms of the soul.
His velvet jacket, carelessly buttoned, betrayed perfectly
white linen, one of the criterions of a man of good
taste<sp>....</sp> When he sat down on a bench, it seemed as
if his frame folded itself up, just as if he had no
backbone. His whole bearing thus showed a kind of nervous
weakness.”

This parallel shows in what a high degree Lermontof
had himself in mind in the representation of the person
of Petchórin, and any one familiar with the whole work
will easily see how much of Petchórin there is also
found in the distracted leading characters in his two
greatest poems, “The Demon” and “Ismael-Bey.”

Lermontof<footnote>Of the Scotch family of Learmont originally.</footnote> was born in Moscow. While yet a boy, he

visited the wild, picturesque mountain regions of the
Caucasus, absorbed Byronism, studied at the university
in his native city, went through the school for
gentlemen’s sons at St. Petersburg, and left it as cornet in the
hussar regiment, and while only a young officer was
already known for wanton and indecent verse. The
poem Hadji-Abrék, written in his early youth, is strong
and harsh as a fantasy of Mérimée written in verse.
In 1837 the twenty-three-years-old poet was for the first
time exiled to the Caucasus and for a reason possible
only in Russia, for his elegy on Pushkin’s death, which
simply expressed what everybody felt, the Tsar included,
but in which Lermontof had shown the boldness to call
on Nicholas for vengeance on the murderer, who was
one of the favorites of the Imperial Court — as he
afterwards in the reign of Napoleon III. was one of the
courtiers, best known for his shameless appearance in the
Senate as the leader of Orthodoxy against Sainte-Beuve.

At the end of a year Lermontof was pardoned, and
then lived for some time in St. Petersburg, where he was
already highly esteemed as a poet. He published his
“Song of the Tsar Iván Vasilyevitch, of his young chief
of the life guard, and the bold merchant Kalashnikof.”
Pushkin had already tried his hand at giving the keynote
of the old <i>bîlinî</i>, yet only in purely romantic poems.
Lermontof reproduced the spirit of the historical and
heroic <i>bîlinî</i> in a graceful little epic, sustained in the
most correct style, which breathes the whole spirit of the
age of Iván III., expressed with pure native simplicity.
What an artist he was, this demon in human form, who
as a boy was man, and who died in his youth after having
produced works of undying importance.

And at the same time he wrote a host of short lyrical
poems, in which his proud soul unreservedly exposes
his stubbornness. Pushkin could yield, allow himself to
be won over, compromise, become a patriot of brutality,
— he, never! His friends disappointed and betrayed
him. He continued faithful in friendship. Others were
reconciled to what they hated. He continued faithful
to himself in his hate. The greatness and elevation of
his inner being exposed him ever and again to a fall.
He continued to experience great emotions and to think
freely. He was surrounded by spies, suspected when
he was silent, accused when he spoke, denounced,
slandered, hated, abandoned. He was always far greater
and stronger than his fate. He never bowed the knee
to Baal.

They reviled him for being a poor patriot. He
answered: “I do indeed love my fatherland, but I can
feel no enthusiasm for barbarity. I do not value that
fame which is bought with blood, nor that proud
confidence which relies on bayonets, and least of all in the
glory of the heroes of antiquity.” (The poem “My
Fatherland.”) And a similar outburst of contempt and
disgust for bloody honor ends the masterly battle-piece
“Valerik.” How conventional does not Pushkin appear
in comparison!

The most hidden emotions of Lermontof are revealed 
in the collection “Little Conceits and Fancies.”
“They tortured him because he dared to think, stoned
him because he dared to speak; they could make no
answer, and that was the sole cause of their frenzy.”
“But he did not envy them their decorations, nor their
servility by which they were won. They robbed him of
everything except his pride and his courage. He was
on fire for the beautiful, fought for the true. The
others found that to be bad and dangerous. When
liberty is taken from him, long, solitary contemplation
changed his hate to boundless contempt. He knew that
a single prayer for mercy, a single repentant word, would
open to him all paths, but he would rather fall down in
his chains than say the one lying word which could save
him. He does not grudge the others their pleasures; he
allows the others to deplore his condition; he would
rather suffer everything than be like them.”

In 1840 Lermontof was a second time banished to the
Caucasus, for a duel with a son of the French minister,
the historian of literature, Barante. In principle he was
opposed to duels, but, as a nobleman and an officer, he
could not free himself from the laws of society which
were honored about him. Shortly after he left the
capital, his romance, “The Hero of Our Time,” appeared.
In this book several characters are found, the prototypes
of which could be found in the higher ranks of society
of his day. A comrade of Lermontof, Martynof, felt
that he was insulted in several places in the book.
Probably he thought himself portrayed in the person
of Gruzhnitski. When the poet, one day, made a joke
about him, the latter embraced the opportunity for a
challenge. In the duel which followed, Lermontof was
killed, on July 15, 1841, pierced through the heart. A
memorial to him was raised at Pyatigorsk, in the
vicinity of which he fell.

There was a demon in him, a ruling spirit, hot and
cold, good and cruel, wild and tender; cherishing
independence in defiance of everything above him, and to
emancipation from everything which would cling to him.
Young as Lermontof was, he was often obliged to ask
himself if he was not possessed of an evil spirit, — one
which gained him women, who soon became a burden to
him; one which laughed disdainfully at him, and mocked
him, where others were moved pathetically. If he had
lived more than the twenty-seven years which were
vouchsafed to him, this question would not have troubled
him more. He would then have felt that his powers
were sound, his right secure, his nature rich and great,
and that the source of his being was situated beyond
the contrast between good and evil.

We have from him only the above peerless prose
romance and several volumes of poems, in which there
are several erasures, which are real gaps, made by the
censor.<footnote>The same imbecile censor who forbade all representations of
women in statuary which “were not fully dressed, — that is, from the
chin to the knees.”</footnote> Of his “Stories for Children,” we see that
what we, for example, possess of the “Demon” — this
poem which is so popular in Russia that the illustrations 
to it are to be seen on every wall, and that Rubinstein 
has made it the text of one of his operas — is in
reality so little that, in the opinion of the poet, “there
is not left a trace of the demoniac nature of the spirit.”
Nevertheless, how high does not this “Demon” stand
above De Vigny’s celebrated “Eloa.”

The whole romance of the Caucasian country lives in
this poetry, — nature and man saturated with a wild,
heroic spirit, illuminated by youthful defiance, like
lightning in lightning. No one describes so fascinatingly as
Lermontof the solitary ride of a young Circassian prince
through the mountain-paths of the Caucasus. No one
like him has pictured a battle between the Cossacks and
the Caucasians. Pushkin’s battle picture in “Poltava”
is powerful and pompous: it is a poet’s fantastic
reconstruction of a past. In Lermontof’s “Valerick” every
little trait has been experienced, seen, and reproduced
in so striking and admirable a manner, that no other
poem brings us nearer to him. We see him by himself,
as he lies there before the battle begins, with the white
tents of the camp stretched out before his eyes, while
the Cossack horses, small and thin, stand with hanging
heads by his side. We feel the sun burn, catch a glimpse
of the Cossack sentinels, two by two, in the distance,
hear the first bullets and the first cries. And the more
thoroughly we become acquainted with Lermontof as a
man and as an author, the dearer he becomes to us.

It is emblematical that his life was a series of slights
and exiles in a land where, as he himself has somewhere
said, “no one comes forward, except those who go
backward.” His poetry produces its effect by its strong
personal originality. He began, like all Russian authors,
under foreign influences, particularly the German
romanticism of terror, — a work of his youth has the title
<i>Menschen und Leidenschaften;</i> afterwards, like the Poles
and Pushkin, he looks up to Byron as the great poet of
the age; but, although he dies so very young, younger
even than Shelley, his manly and proud face stands out
before us with pure and distinct features.

He was too much occupied with his own thoughts and
his own affairs to be able to unfold the broad Russia to
our gaze; he was a revolutionary romanticist, but still
a romanticist. Shortly after him, or at the same time
with him, new influences had begun to exert a force in
Russian literature and intellectual life, which were
destined to displace him and Pushkin.

<h2><small>IV.</small></h2>

<sc>With</sc> Gogol a new inspiration came to Europe from
Russia. With him, authors ceased to describe themselves.
He was wholly absorbed by his subject, and the reader no
longer received the impression of the spiritual life of a man
of the world and a cosmopolite, but of the national
peculiarities of the subject as it was displayed in the soul of
a genuine Russian. Gogol possessed an extraordinarily
artistic talent, which two or three times rose to genius,
but which speedily declined, because it was a genius
without moral views, which was supported neither by
culture nor character.

Nikolaï Vasilyevitch Gogol (1809-1852) was by birth a
Little Russian, and as a child grew up in the midst of
traditions of the bold and eventful Cossack troopers in the
Ukraine. His father, an impoverished landed proprietor, 
possessed no mean capacities as a narrator and actor,
which the son inherited from him. As a boy, he had
already displayed a considerable power of observation of
human stupidity and weakness.

In St. Petersburg, he tried without success the career
of an actor, and then that of a government official, when,
by the aid of Pushkin, he obtained a position as professor
of history in the university. He utterly failed in this,
on account of a lack of preparatory knowledge and
defective education, and abandoned it for the profession of an
author.

He made his <i>début</i> as a humorist, — a strong and 
confident humorist, — who used his talent on subjects of small
compass, taken at first from the country life of Little
Russia, which he knew so thoroughly, and then from the
lower, poorer, gay, disorderly life in St. Petersburg. In
these tales, he weaves into his pictures of real life a
free imagination. That he starts from romanticism is
shown by such tales as “King of the Spirits of Earth,”
“Notes of a Lunatic,” or “The Nose.” This last story,
which is essentially a study after E. T. A. Hoffman, is
the wildest <i>capriccio</i> on the theme: a suddenly lost and
then regained nose, an ingenious and humorous story
for children of an older growth, but without any deeper
meaning. The celebrated history of the “Quarrel
between Iván Ivánovitch and Iván Nikiforovitch" is a
humorous, amusing story, well carried through in style,
on the all-consuming spirit of frivolity and conceit in
Little Russia, written in much the same style as
Gottfried Keller later wrote his humorous stories about the
faults and vices of the Swiss.

With the historical romance “Taras Bulba,” which, in
Russia, is of repute as an heroic epic, Gogol entered upon
a new path. The narrative describes the heroic period
in the Cossack world during the struggles for liberty
against the Poles. But in spite of the greatness of the
style and the realism with which this picture of a wild,
extinct past is painted, the book has the common defects
of historical romances. The idealism which, as a rule,
has dictated them weakens their effect. That which is
most beautiful in them is not true; we feel behind the
whole description that he started out with the intention
of glorification; we notice how the author puts
opportunities in the way of this heroism, which in the middle of
the battle displays itself in a single combat, and fastens
upon it the gaze of all.

Among the longer and shorter stories in the first three
volumes of Gogol there is not one which is out and out
worthy of admiration, except “The Cloak.” It is the
simple story of a poor St. Petersburg official who
through half his life has needed a Spanish cloak, which
he finally obtains, and from whom it is stolen. De
Voguë quotes a saying of a Russian author, “We have
all grown out of Gogol’s ‘cloak.’” There is this truth
in it, that the whole of the modern emotional Russian
naturalism descends in a direct line from this little story.
Dostoyevski’s first book, “Poor Folk,” may be named as
having had its germ here.

Nevertheless, even this classical story does not give to
the Western European reader the standard of Gogol’s high
rank as a modern author. That is done only by his play,
“The Reviser,” and the first part of the romance, “Dead
Souls.” It is the stinging satire and the bold fidelity to
nature, expressed in a vigorous style, which here first
betrayed Gogol’s great superiority to the circumstances
in which he was born, and which showed that Russian
literature was ready to launch out into an entirely new
field, which demanded boldness and originality to enter,
and which this literature silently, as it were, pointed out
to that of several other countries lost in romanticism,
as the path which alone emerges from the world of
dreams.

However Aristophanic the satire is in “Dead Souls,”
the theories on which this comic epic rests are so
peculiar that they appear to the foreign reader like a story
from another part of the world or from a remote age.
Outside of Russia, even the cunning conceit about which
everything in the story revolves can hardly be
understood: the idea of the audacious speculator, of buying
up dead serfs, who were still nominally counted as 
living, carrying them to a worthless tract of land, and then
mortgaging them to a bank.

The drama, “The Reviser,” on the other hand, is perfectly 
intelligible everywhere, and is as pointed as it is
simple in its plot. More than twenty-five years were
demanded to raise the Norse drama, under Henrick
Ibsen, to this height; the German drama has not yet
attained it.

It is said that it was Pushkin who gave Gogol the
idea of “The Reviser.” If so, he deserves just as much
honor for it as for any finished work of his own of any
kind whatever. For there is hardly a single play in
modern literature which can compare with it in wit.
But it is improbable that Gogol is greatly indebted to
Pushkin for this. For a careful examination shows that
his two great modern works, “The Reviser” and “Dead
Souls,” notwithstanding all the differences required by
the forms of drama and romance, are alike in all
essential points. In both, the fundamental defects of
different ranks and types of a whole community are subjected
to a test, in which all these men are brought in
connection with a single person, a rather common but shameless
sort of a being, before whom they stand as before a
mystery they are not sure of having penetrated. In the
play, this person makes, directly or indirectly, unusual
claims upon them, because he is regarded by them as a
superior officer sent by the government to inquire into
their conduct, and whom, with their guilty consciences,
they meet with bent backs and full hands. In the
novel, this person makes an unusual proposal to them,
because he offers them a bargain never heard of before, —
the disposal of their dead souls; but in both cases he
compels them to unveil their true characters and
disclose their weakest points.

Nowhere else in the comic literature known to me is
there found a more vigorous comic <i>dénouement</i> than that
which is presented just after the disappearance of
Khlestyakof with all the spoils he has secured and the
recollections of the favors he has enjoyed from the
ladies, when the coming of the real reviser is announced,
and we feel that a day of judgment is breaking in upon
the sinners who have just bought their freedom in the
wrong place.

As is well known, the government had serious misgivings 
about allowing “The Reviser” to appear. Finally
Nicholas gave his consent, and at the first performance
burst into such laughter that he called the author to his
box and said to him: “I have never laughed before as
I have this evening.” — “I had really aimed at another
effect,” was Gogol’s manly answer.

And yet he did not himself comprehend the scope of
his comedy; it was the product of a satirical genius, not
of a conviction. With his deficient culture he was a
Russian patriot in the sense that all the Russian
institutions and peculiarities were good, viz.: absolute power,
bureaucracy, suppression of all individual independence,
and above all Greek Orthodoxy. When he became
melancholy with his advancing years, it came over him
that his principal satirical works were wicked, traitorous
to his fatherland, and he bitterly repented of them. In
1846 he surprised the Russian reading world by the
publication of his “Selected Correspondence,” in which
he declared war against the civilization of Western
Europe, glorified re-action and obscurantism, nay,
furnished a defence for serfdom.

In this condition of mind, to make amends for the
first part of “Dead Souls,” he wrote an unreadable
second part, with purely virtuous persons. He became
absorbed in theological meditations. His friends in vain
sent him abroad to travel to liberate him from his
conceptions of the decadence of the heathen Western Europe.
He journeyed from St. Petersburg to Wiesbaden, from
Wiesbaden to Paris and Rome, and undertook a pilgrimage 
from Rome to Jerusalem. The revolution of 1848
finally made him an unconditional supporter and admirer
of the system of government of the Tsar Nicholas and
brought him to the highest degree of Orthodox
fanaticism. Four years after he was found one winter day in
Moscow, starved to death before a shrine, before which
he was accustomed to lie for days in silent prayer.<footnote>“Taras Bulba,” “Dead Souls,” “St. John’s Eve and Other
Stories,” including “The Cloak,” have been translated by Isabel F.
Hapgood. (T. Y. Crowell & Co., N.Y.) Prosper Mérimée has made
a masterly translation of “The Reviser” in French.</footnote>

We pay little heed to the fact that a man like Gogol
was a Little Russian. The reason for this is that, as
soon as his son manifested a turn for poetry, his father
gave him the decided advice to write only in Great
Russian, and that Gogol followed his advice. Almost all
the authors born in Little Russia, in view of the
contempt with which their language has been treated as a
peasant tongue, good for common people, in which they
could only address themselves to a public of
schoolteachers and popes, have written in one of the great
neighboring languages, Russian or Polish. The Little
Russians Padura, Tchaikovski, Groza, have thus in the
beginning only written in their mother tongue and later
in Polish. The same thing is also true of Bogdan Zabski.<footnote>See G. Brandes: <i>Indtryk fra Polen</i>, pp. 227.</footnote>
For, however much the Polish language is set aside and
suppressed, the suppression it endures is not like that
which is used towards the Little-Russian tongue, against
which a real war of extermination has by degrees been
finally reached.

No single person has been hit harder in this war than
Gogol’s contemporary Taras Grigorovitch Shevtchenko
(1814-1861), the greatest poet whom the Little-Russian
people have ever produced. While the other poets in
the Little-Russian dialect have built wholly upon the
popular ballads of the Ukraine, appropriated them and
carried them farther by adding individual personality,
European culture, and artistic style, Shevtchenko alone,
although he is poet of the people above everything, has
raised himself high above the level hitherto attained by
the Little-Russian literature.

Shevtchenko was born in a village in the department
of Kief, and was the son of a serf peasant who belonged
to a rude German landed proprietor, Engelhard. At the
age of eight he had a stepmother who tormented him,
and at eleven he lost his father. He was sent to school
to the parish clerk, a drunken scamp, who flogged the
boy and treated him cruelly, for fear that he, by his
rapid progress, would soon outshine him in knowledge
and deprive him of his bread. The boy ran away,
roamed about homeless for some time, and then came a
second time under instruction, this time under a servant
of the church who painted shrines, in order to learn the
art from him. This one also whipped him so inhumanly
that he ran away and took a place as a swineherd in
the village where he was born. Here his master’s
attention was drawn to the remarkable swineherd who could
read and draw, and he took him into his personal service
as bootblack and pipe-cleaner. When he was caught
copying pictures with a stolen pencil, on paper also
stolen, Engelhard had him punished with the knout;
that was at least suitable for a serf. Nevertheless, when
it became certain in many ways that the boy had talent,
he sent him to a painting master in St. Petersburg, in
hopes of getting the money he laid out on him richly
repaid in due time. Here Shevtchenko began to draw
with his own hand, awakened the interest of an artist,
who recommended him to Zhukovski. The latter, ready
and humane as he always was, took the young man’s
cause in hand. The first thing to be done was to buy his
freedom. Engelhard asked twenty-five hundred rubles
for this “soul.” Zhukovski had his portrait, which the
court-painter Brylof, who has been previously spoken of,
was going to paint, sold by lottery and obtained the sum
needed. In 1838 the emancipated serf began his studies
in the Academy, and, having served his time, left it in
1844 to go to Little Russia to find there subjects for
pictures and poems.

In the mean time, he had begun to write verse. In
1840 he had already published his first collection of
poems, <i>Khobzar</i> (The Singer), — lyrical tendency poems,
which with deep national feeling dwelt on the heroic
memories of the Little-Russian people, their sufferings 
in the past and their hopes for the future. His
anxiety for everything which could operate for the
breaking-up of the monotony in the empire, manifested
in this collection of poems, made the government
withdraw all support from Shevtchenko, and place him under
the supervision of the police. The year after, he
published his largest work, the Little-Russian epic poem,
“The Haïdamáks," and still later several different smaller
poems in the almanacs. In a poem called “Caucasus,”
he commemorated an unfortunate friend of his, Count
Balmén, who on account of his liberal views had been
sent as a common soldier to the Caucasian army. For
this imprudence Shevtchenko, in spite of his reputation,
was condemned in 1847 to be whipped, and, after the
execution of that sentence, to go as a common soldier to
Orenburg. He was also most strictly forbidden to write.

At first he remained for some time in Orenburg itself,
then in the fortress of Orsk; then he took part in an
expedition to Lake Aral, and at last he was transferred
to fort Nev-Petrovsk on the Asiatic shore of the Caspian
Sea.

While still in Orenburg, he had again followed his
irresistible impulse to write. Thousands of copies of
his poems of freedom and vengeance, which then issued
from his pen, were distributed in the Ukraine, and,
during the time of the revolt in 1848, were printed in
Galicia. A second time he was punished by the lash.
It did not crush him. But in Nev-Petrovsk, whither he
was last taken, and where the garrison was made up of
the most worthless dregs of society, while the duty was
the most arduous that can be imagined, and where
neither a human being in whom the poet could confide,
nor even a book or newspaper, could be found, he
sickened, and slowly grew stupid.

When, after the lapse of seven years (1857), his
admirers in St. Petersburg, especially Countess Alexis
Tolstoï, at last obtained his discharge from the military
service, the commander of the fort was able to support
the petition by the statement, “The man is harmless.”
He went to St. Petersburg, and there wrote, with powers
flaming up anew, a bitterly scornful poem, “The Brothers’
Mission,” against Russian Panslavism, which would free
other people, but cruelly oppress the Slavic races in
Russia, published several works anonymously, and wrote
a short autobiography.

He was cured of the uncritical enthusiasm of his
youth for the Cossack part of the Ukraine. 
“Hetmanship” had lost its romantic halo for him. Against the
traditions of its nobility he now placed the idea of the
amelioration of the peasants; and against the literary
world of the Slavophiles, he proposed what they forgot
or overlooked, — the severe distress of the people of
Little Russia, the misery which thraldom and ignorance
has brought upon them.

He died in St. Petersburg in February, 1861, and,
according to his wish, he was buried in Kaniof in the
Ukraine. However much ill he had personally suffered,
however great was the persecution of the Little-Russian
nationality to which he had been a witness, still he did
not live to see what would have afflicted him more than
any personal torture to which he had been subjected, —
the prohibition issued in 1875, and constantly enforced
down to the present time, against printing or publishing
in the Russian Empire any kind of a book or newspaper
in the Little-Russian language.

Shevtchenko’s poetry is thus not only the highest and
richest expression which the race to which he belongs
has attained in literature, but it is for the present its last
expression. His gifts are varied; he wrote political
lyrics, idylls, love poems, short sketches of society in
verse, and a great historical epic in the spirit of the
elder Dumas, which among the modern Slavic epics
is surpassed only by Mickiewicz’s incomparable “Pan
Tadeusz.” “The Haïdamáks” (that is, the Cossack
warriors) treats of the last independent revolt of the
Little-Russian popular spirit, the Cossack insurrection of 1770
under Gonta. It was directed against the nobility of
Poland, who in those days oppressed the Ukraine in a
cruel manner, and who, when it came to the point, were
too imbecile and disorganized to defend themselves.
But the Russian government, which was alarmed lest the
disturbances should spread within the confines of Russia,
determined to interfere. The leader of the Russian
army, Romanzov, proposed to Gonta an alliance against
the Poles, lured him and the officer next in command
into an ambush, and immediately delivered them to their
enemies. Then the Cossack army, which had been
deprived of its leaders, was surrounded, captured, and
fully eight thousand men were divided in crowds among
the cities of Poland for execution. Gonta and the other
chiefs were broken alive on the wheel, and all the
common men without exception were executed in different
ways. They generally preferred suffocation to hanging,
on account of its convenience, and to save the trees.
This is the subject which Shevtchenko, without going
out of his way for horrors, has presented, describing the
cruelties the oppressed were guilty of as fully as those
which were inflicted upon them, even to the extent that
this historic scene furnishes the background for the fate
of a pair of lovers.

His little pictures of society, which are usually idyllic
and emotional, are not wanting in marks of an energy
which sees life as it is at its worst. In one of the best,
“The Drowned,” he tells the story of a mother and
daughter who lived in a country village, and whose
ghosts now on moonlight nights are seen hovering to
and fro over the steppes along the banks of the streams.
The mother was a Russian, proud and sensual, rich and
beautiful, a young widow, who held a court for her
admirers. She gave birth to the daughter secretly, and
put her out to nurse in a poor Little-Russian peasant
family. The daughter grew up, became an extraordinary
beauty, and when the mother finally took her home, she
received more attention in the rich house than the
mother. When the latter became possessed with jealous
hate, she gave her daughter poison, and when the poison
did not result in death, she went with her to take a bath,
seized her by her long braids of hair, and hurled her out
into the eddies of the stream, where she met with death.

There runs through this poem the attempt to show the
coarse and cruel traits of character in the Great-Russian
race, without sparing the poet’s own countrymen. But
the vices he upbraids them for are the vices of the
oppressed: self-abandonment and cowardice. Thus in
the poem, “Taras’s Night,” the singer narrates for the
Little-Russian youth of the country the achievements of
the great hetman, Taras Triasylo. The circle listen
with tears in their eyes. But immediately after the
listeners begin to sing and dance with happy recklessness.
Then the singer shouts to them, “Lie behind the stove;
it is warm and safe! I will go to the inn and make
jokes about the Poles and Muskovites. Will you go
with me? That you can still do. But you can no
longer have any spirit.”<footnote>Pypin: <i>Geschichte der Slavischen Litteraturen</i>, i. 480. K. E.
Franzos: <i>Von Don zur Donau</i>, i. 85-126. Selected pieces of Shevtchenko
have been translated into German by J. G. Obiest.</footnote>

The history of Russian literature counts martyrs and
apostles in great number. The life of Shevtchenko is a
prolonged martyrdom; among the other great men of
Russia who bore their part of the martyrdom is the
apostle of activity who first attracted the attention of
posterity. A long time imprisoned, twice exiled, and
finally banished, Alexander Ivánovitch Herzen
(1812-1870) is the apostle of the new times for Russia.

He is, as a spirit, among the Russians of this century,
what the year 1848 is among the years of the century.
He is the year 1848 in human form, an incarnation of all
the ideas which that year came to the front, and of all the
noble struggles for liberty which were then set in motion.

Herzen’s father was a rich Russian <i>grand seigneur</i>,
Yakovlef, a retired captain of the Guard, with a colossal
fortune, who had received his whole culture from his
journeys in Western Europe, — a disciple of Voltaire, who
read only French and spoke it better than Russian. His
mother was a young lady, the daughter of a tradesman,
Louise Herzen, from Stuttgart, who, at the age of
seventeen, consented to accompany the rich Russian gentleman
who had won her heart to his home in Moscow, and who
was always treated as his wife, although no marriage
ceremony had taken place between them. The son was born
a few months before the French troops marched into
Moscow, and it was the great event in his father’s life
that Napoleon, who was in want of a messenger to the
Tsar, sent for the Russian nobleman, who was of old
known to his Marshal Mortier, and gave him a letter,
“To my brother, the Tsar Alexander,” and gave him
safe conduct out of the burning city.

His father developed constantly more and more into
a bitter, reserved, aristocratic eccentricity, wholly
absorbed in a boundless contempt for the human race.
His mother was an unhappy, solitary creature, with
intellect and heart. In the son, the qualities of parents
and ancestors were so mingled as to amount to genius.

He has written his life, — reminiscences in three
volumes, — and this work ought not to be neglected by any
one who takes an interest in the struggle for the
development of modern Russia. There is no better insight
accessible to us. With artistic clearness, with the
unreservedness of an author of memoirs, Herzen has told, not
only the life of his boyhood and youth to his thirty-fifth
year, but he has given the description of a superior, 
incisive, and penetrating observer of the social, political, and
literary conditions of Russia between 1812 and 1847, and
especially of the reign of Nicholas. The observer of the
conditions is also the victim of them; yet he has no pity
for himself, and when he can he uncovers the humorous
side of his misfortunes. But with withering scorn, with
an indignant, harrowing contempt for the throne, with a
heart which moans and bleeds, he spreads before the eye
of the reader the heartrending cruelty which proceeded
from the throne of the Tsar, and all that spirit of
thraldom, corruption, and stupidity which made such a rule
possible.

He never dwells upon the horrible, and yet it is a
question if even Dostoyevski’s Recollections of the
Dead House in Siberia contain pictures which fill one
with a deeper sense of terror. (See, for example, about
the torture in the prisons.)<footnote><i>Mémoires de Herzen</i>, i. 290 and following.</footnote>

With Herzen and his friends, modern knowledge and
modern philosophy force their way into the Russian
Empire. He and his fellow-students were first inspired
by the languid liberalism of Lafayette and Benjamin
Constant, and then, after the suppression of the Polish
revolt of 1831, went through a rigorous course of
Saint-Simonism. At the age of fifty, Herzen writes in his
reminiscences on this subject, “A new age knocked at
the door; our souls, our hearts were opened to its
coming. Saint-Simonism laid the foundation for our
convictions, and constitutes, even at the present time, an
essential part of them.” The young men were inspired
by the two fundamental ideas: the calling of woman to
share in the common duties, and what they at that time
called “the justification or the honorable satisfaction of
the flesh.” An idea, says Herzen, to which people with
an imagination which reminds one of the imagination of
lewd monks have wanted to give a low and cynical
interpretation, but which, in reality, only means
dethronement of Christianity, the religion of beauty and life,
which supplanted the religion of asceticism and death.<footnote><i>Mémoires de Herzen</i>, i. 236.</footnote>

From the fact that some other students, with whom
this group of young men had no connection, late one
evening, at the instance of a member of the secret police,
had sung a song in which some abusive language could
be taken as pointing at the Tsar, Herzen, his friend and
late companion-in-arms the poet Ogaref, and many others
equally innocent, were first kept in prison for months,
and then sent away. Herzen was first exiled to Vyatka,
on the Siberian frontier, where he happened to fall under
a governor by the name of Tiufayef, who most
resembled a wild and malignant beast, and afterwards to
Vladimir, only a day’s journey from Moscow. On the way to
his exile, he became thoroughly acquainted with the
Russian situation in its worst aspects, among other
things falling in with a convoy of eight wagon-loads
of small Jewish boys, the most of them between eight
and ten years of age, who were sent to military colonies;
a third part of them had already died on the way.<footnote>Comp. G. Brandes: <i>Indtryk fra Polen</i>, p. 67.</footnote>
From Vladimir, Herzen eloped with his young cousin,
whom he had loved for many years, and whom they had
endeavored to prevent from marrying him. In her
society, he passed the fifth and last year of his exile, and
lived happily for many years, until their marriage
relations came to a tragic end in London. George Herwegh
here, for a short time, won the heart of the young
Russian; but she died of a broken heart in consequence of
her infidelity to her first and, in reality, her only love.
A letter of Turgenief to Saltykof, dated January 19,
1876, shows that there exists an unprinted account,
written by Herzen, of the bitterest catastrophe of his life.

On his return to Moscow, Herzen found the youth
filled with Hegel’s philosophy. When he saw that he
was regarded as outside of agitations, he devoted himself
to the encyclopædia, logic, the science of phenomena,
æsthetics; studied and canvassed them paragraph by
paragraph; at last, he devoured every single Hegelian
writing he could obtain, from the nearest disciples of
Hegel to the liberal Hegelian Arnold Ruges. Herzen
interpreted the teachings of the master entirely in the
spirit of the young Hegelians. While others, as, for
instance, the great critic Byelinski, Herzen’s intimate
friend, accepted in a purely conservative spirit the
well-known sentence from the preface to the “Philosophy of
the Right,” “That which is reasonable is real, and that
which is real is reasonable,” so that they only found in
it the justification of the Russian absolute power, with
all the crimes which flourished in its bosom, Herzen saw
in it only the simple expression of the principle of <i>the
adequate cause</i>, broke with Byelinski, until he — for that
matter very soon — gave up his quietism, and, on his
side, found in Hegel’s philosophy an algebra of
revolution, which freed the spirit by not leaving one stone
upon another of the Christian world of tradition. And
when Ogaref brought him Feuerbach’s “Spirit of
Christianity,” on reading this work, he felt himself at once
wholly emancipated. And in his first philosophical
enthusiasm he wrote the series of articles which he
published in 1842, with the title, “Dilettantism in
Knowledge,” by Iskander (that is, Alexander).

Shortly before Herzen’s return from exile, Tschaadayef 
had published the celebrated “Philosophical 
Letters” about the insignificance of Russia to European
culture, its everlasting coming too late. To punish him
for this, he was declared and treated as insane by the
Tsar. Byelinski, “the Lessing of Russia,” already far
gone in consumption, which carried him off when only
thirty-eight years old, now began his impassioned
literary campaign with the official world and the official
literature. When “The Annals of our Fatherland,”
appeared on the 25th of each month, the whole
cultured youth were in a fever to get hold of the thick
volume. They were continually asking during the whole
forenoon, in the cafés, if the number had come; as soon
as it arrived, they tore it open with the question, “Is
there anything of Byelinski’s in it?” If only one page
was found of his, it was devoured eagerly and debated in
endless discussions.

His fire, his sarcasm, his sneers, his unmaskings
enchained all, and people flocked together where he
swung his whip, as if to see an execution. Almost on
his death-bed, he attacked his disciple Gogol for his
back-sliding. As the disciple of the culture of Western
Europe, he cut down pedants and Slavophiles.

When he died, his friends were forbidden to place an
epitaph at his grave. The newspapers were forbidden to
mention his name, and the prohibition has remained in
force for full eighteen years.

It fell to Herzen’s lot to carry Byelinski’s literary
purification and reformation into the political arena.
He was admirably constituted for such a contest, which
was to endure for many years. He was not spindling
and weak like his friend, but large and broad-shouldered,
a powerful frame, and not poor and therefore dependent,
but after his father’s death he was in possession of what,
even by Russian standards, would be regarded as a large
fortune. Thus, all that was needed was that he should
obtain leave to pass over the Russian frontier, so that,
with solid ground under his feet, he could use his great
talent as a writer in shaking up Russia in all its joints.

He was the creator of a public sentiment in the
Russian Empire.

In Paris, where he first took refuge, he formed a
league with the party of the French socialists and the
Polish emigrants. What he felt when the great storm
of insurrection burst over Europe, and when one
popular revolt after another was suppressed, all the promises
of kings and pope were broken, and contra-revolutions
were victorious along the whole line, is shown by his
two books, written in the most fascinating style, “From
the Other Side of the Stream,” and “Letters from Italy
and France.” They were published anonymously in
1850, and first in German, having been translated by
Frederick Kapp, who subsequently became the well
known German-American historian, and who at that time
was a tutor in Herzen’s house. It is sixteen years since
I read these books, and they are not now at hand, but
the impression is as vivid now as when I first read them.
Never has manly political enthusiasm found a more
elegant or more lucid expression, and never have
disappointment and contempt spoken in more energetic language.

From Paris Herzen went to London, and there, during
the Crimean War, established his liberal “Russian
Press,” and published in London from 1857 to 1865, and
in Geneva from 1865 to 1869, his celebrated weekly paper,
<i>Kólokol</i>, whose overwhelming influence in Russia has
been previously spoken of, as well as the manner in
which this influence was destroyed by Katkóf.

The same year in which Alexander Herzen went into
exile, he published a novel, which is still worth reading,
less for its literary value than on account of the
movements to which it gave rise in Russia. It is the romance
“Who is to Blame?” (1847), an indirect attack on
marriage as an institution, dedicated to the author’s
wife “with hearty devotion.” The book is written
without any regular plot, with a long-winded introductory
historical sketch, several digressions, and without style ;
but the characters are living as in the better novels of
George Sand. The theme is substantially as follows:
The peaceful, happy marriage between the calm and
amiable teacher Kruziferski and his elegant wife Liubonka
is disturbed when the young, talented but idle man of
the world, Beltof, comes within the sphere of these two
married people. Without any guilt on the part of either,
Beltof and Liubonka are irresistibly attracted to each
other, understand each other, need each other, and
cannot do without each other. They strive to conquer their
passion, but Beltof tears himself away in vain; he
drags himself off on journeys to no purpose, Liubonka
wastes away, Kruziferski takes to drink and is ruined.<footnote><i>Vom andern Ufer; Briefe aus Italien und Frankreich</i>, Hamburg,
1850. <i>Wer ist Schuld?</i> Reclam’s Bibliothek.</footnote>

The idea embodied in this book grew luxuriantly,
since, in 1863, the man who may be regarded as Herzen’s
great intellectual heir, and for a time as inheritor of his
influence, published his celebrated novel, “What is to
be done?”

Nikolaï Gavrilovitch Tchernuishevski was born in 1829,
the son of a pope in Saratof on the Volga, and was first
destined for the clergy, but soon gave up theology for
the study of ancient and modern languages, and, in
1846, began his career as a philologist in the university
of St. Petersburg. After passing his examinations, he
became Professer of Literature in the Cadet School in
St. Petersburg, but soon after, at the desire of his
mother, who could not bear to be separated from him,
he accepted a position as teacher in the grammar school
in his native town. Here he was married at the age of
twenty-two. After his mother’s death in 1853, he
returned to the capital, wrote a thesis on the relations of
art to nature, but in his oral defence gave utterance to
such radical ideas that the minister of education refused
him his diploma.

From 1853 to 1862 he wrote for Niekrásof’s newspaper,
<i>Sovremennik</i>, a large number of articles and
discussions of an economical, critical, and historical character,
which, from their way of treating the problems, and by
their ironic, satirical tone, awakened the greatest
attention. Tchernuishevski presented and criticised John
Stuart Mill’s “Political Economy,” the æsthetic criticism
of the Gogolian period, the party quarrels in France
during the Restoration, Lessing and his age, etc., treated
with the same superiority subjects of widely different
kinds, but had his principal interests centred on the
solution of certain great social problems, — the
arrangement of the relations between the sexes, the abolition
of serfdom, the abrogation of all individual property in
land for the good of the community.

Everything that he wrote was passed by the censor.
But in July, 1862, to the astonishment of all,
Tchernuishevski was arrested, and kept in custody in the
Petro-Pavlovsk prison, on the island of Neva, until May, 1864.

On the 24th of May, 1864, about eight o’clock in the
morning, in a pouring rain, a great crowd of men was
collected in St. Petersburg around a scaffold with a
pillory surrounded by soldiers in a hollow square.
Presently the wagon which was expected drove up, escorted
by gendarmes on horseback, and out of it alighted first
a general and then a pale man, dressed as a civilian.
The latter ascended the scaffold, where two men with
red caps took him by the arms, hung a black plate over
his neck, on which his sentence was written in white
letters. Then one of the executioners took his hat off
his head so that he should listen reverently to what was
to be read to him.

It was his indictment. It was long enough; closely
printed, it fills over six hundred lines; it took more
than an hour to read. But it would be difficult to find
a legal document with less foundation for its charges.

“Several circumstances,” it says, “have pointed out
to the government the said Tchernuishevski as an agitator
dangerous to the State.” These circumstances are:
first, an anonymous letter sent to the Third Section (the
secret police). This letter, which is quoted at length
with all its vulgarity and stupidity, calls upon the
government to free the people from Tchernuishevski. In
the second place, an intercepted letter from the exile
Alexander Herzen, in which is found, “We intend to
publish <i>Sovremennik</i> here or in London with
Tchernuishevski.” For these two things Tchernuislievski was
imprisoned. Now follows in the indictment the list of
the papers “belonging to the case,” that is, a letter from
the accused to his wife, in which he says that they both
belong to history, so that their names will be known for
centuries, and the production of a newspaper article
from 1853, which was now in 1862 found to be
dangerous.

In all this, however, there is no foundation for any
legal proceedings. But while the accused is in prison,
in March, 1863, they were fortunate enough in the Third
Section to obtain possession of a letter from a certain
Kostomarof to one of his friends, in which it is said
that “Tchernuishevski had written the appeal to the
serfs.” As proof of the truth of this contention, a note
found in the pocket of Kostomarof is read, which,
observe, was when he had already been a long time in
prison, sentenced, ready to be sent away to exile, and
in which he is asked to correct a misprint. The note is
signed “Tcher.” The secretaries of the Senate, before
whom this letter was laid, were not able, it is true, to
find any resemblance to Tchernuishevski’s handwriting
as a whole, even admitting that, when the letters are
taken separately, twelve of the twenty-five letters
resemble his to a certain extent; but the Senate <i>in pleno</i> found
the resemblance striking. With incredible ease it is
said, in the next place, that a <i>copy</i> of Tchernuishevski’s
proclamation to the peasants has been found in the
possession of Kostomarof, although no original is
forthcoming, and although the style bears no resemblance to
that of the great author. And, in conclusion, a letter
is read, full of scratches and erasures, which comes from
the Third Section, and which is presumed to be from
the accused, since it is signed “Tsch,” and directed to
one Alexis Nikolayevitch, who is presumed to be the
poet Pleshcheyef, whose Christian name has the same
sound. Tchernuishevski firmly denied having written
this letter, which, moreover, would have been entirely
innocent in any other place than Russia and modern
Germany. Pleshcheyef denied before the court not less
firmly that he had received it; but they were not
believed. It was regarded as a proof of the attempt of
the accused to stir up the serfs, and his culpability is
increased by his obstinate denial.

“As guilty of participation in a conspiracy for the
destruction of the present political arrangements, N. G.
Tchernuishevski, thirty-five years old, is sentenced to
fourteen years hard labor in the mines, and then to
exile to Siberia for life.”

Immediately after it was announced to him that the
Tsar in his mercy has commuted the fourteen years hard
labor to seven. Then he received an order to kneel
down. They broke a sword over his head, and chained
him for some minutes to the pillory. A bouquet of
flowers falls down at his feet. The bouquets which
follow are thrown into the air by the police. He is
taken to the wagon, and vanishes<sp>....</sp><footnote><i>L’economic politique jugée par le science. Critique des principes
d’economie politique</i>, de John Stuart Mill par N. Tschernuischevski.
Bruxelles, 1874, i.-xxxvi.</footnote>

He vanished, never more to be seen among those who
admired him, and who were indebted to him for the best
part of their intellectual culture. He passed his seven
years among the criminals in the mines underground,
then fifteen years more in solitary exile in one of the
most distant points of Siberia, without books, without
men with whom he could exchange ideas, cut off from
all communion with Europe. A year or two since they
at last found the prisoner sufficiently subdued by his
martyrdom of more than twenty years. They transferred 
him to a milder place of banishment, and allowed
him to occupy himself in a harmless manner by
translations and similar things.

He is now and then visited there by some faithful
admirers, who dare to expose themselves to the odium
which follows upon such visits; and I know of nothing
more significant of the contentment into which public
opinion has sunk in Russia, than the satisfaction with
which those who have seen him express their
impressions on their return: “Tchernuishevski is well," they
say generally; “he is not entirely broken down 
intellectually; <i>he translates from the German.”</i> It has gone
so far in Russia that when a genius, who was the honor
of the nation and the pride of the youth, after having
been abused for a quarter of a century with the coarsest
cruelty, has, nevertheless, not become an idiot, they then
do not think much more of what has happened; they
feel entirely satisfied with the result, — feel about as if
they had made a bet with the government, and, in all
probability, had won it.

Even one who is not competent to judge of the value of
Tchernuishevski’s economical work will read with
pleasure his critical treatise on Mill’s “Political Economy.”
The urbanity of the tone, the crystal clearness of his
description, and the richness of his pertinent psychological 
observations, enchain an outsider. But the three-volume 
novel of Tchernuishevski, which was written in
prison (finished April 4, 1863), “What is to be done?”
has had a far more important influence.<footnote>In French, <i>Que Faire?</i> In German, <i>Was Thun?</i> (Brockhaus,
1883). In English, “A Vital Question” (T. Y. Crowell & Co.).</footnote>

It is not that the book is a fine poetical production,
nor even poetical at all in the true sense of the word.
It is highly intellectual and liberal, a thorough and free
development of the man’s views of life, so far as he
could develop them in a manuscript which must pass
under the inspection of the prison authorities and of the
censor before it could reach the printing-office.

Strange as it may seem to the reader, a radiant good
humor pervades the book, which only towards the end
becomes long-winded and tiresome, partly because
everything must be expressed so indirectly, frequently in a
far-fetched manner, partly because the poor prisoner at
the last felt far too great need of light and air and
freedom and men.

The work was intended and was received as a gospel
for the modern Russia. It was intended to point the
way out of the conflicts which are occasioned in one
direction by the regulation of the sexual relations, and
in another direction by the whole economical disorder of
society. “What is to be done?” is a sort of a bastard
between a novel and a treatise on political economy; it
descends on the female side from George Sand and on
the male from Karl Marx.

Books of this kind have apparently been written
before. In tendency it has a resemblance to the
“Jacques” of George Sand, in its story it also reminds
one strongly of a much older romance, namely Jean
Paul Richter’s <i>Leben, Tod und Ehrestand des
Armenadvokaten Siebenkäs</i>. But still there is no book of this
kind in the literature of the world, and no work in the
whole Russian literature is more Russian.

The argument can be stated in a few lines: The
medical student Lopukhóf marries Viera Pávlovna for love.
They live happily together for a long time. After the
lapse of some years she falls in love with his comrade,
Kirsánof. Lopukhóf, with whose notions it does not
agree to stand in the way of two lovers, apparently
commits suicide and disappears; he travels under another
name to America, returns home some years later, marries
another woman, and continues to live in friendly
relations to his former wife and her husband.

There are many most excellently drawn subsidiary
characters, who take part in the story, who are grouped
around the leading persons. The form of the narrative
is personal to the highest degree. Every moment the
author addresses himself directly to the reader,
humorously makes the ordinary excitement of a novel
impossible, by telling far in advance everything which is going
to happen, pokes fun at the reader’s consternation at the
immorality of the narrator, telling him that it is even
far greater than it appears to be. But in truth this is
not at all a story, but is in all respects a treatise on
social morals. Much which wearies a modern reader,
the description of Viera’s sewing establishment, where
every sewing-girl shares in the receipts, and much more
of the same kind, is for Tchernuishevski only the means
of proclaiming that socialism which he regards as right
and promising for the future. He cannot proclaim his
ideals directly. A careful reading will show that all the
Russian ideas of progress and all the Russian Utopias
are contained in this book.

On a hasty reading one understands nothing at all of
this. The book was not written for the superficial
reader. By an artistic circumlocution the poor prisoner
must inform the reader of his ideas of how the world of
the future will come to look. When he cannot do it
any other way, he lets his heroine fall asleep and tells us
her dreams in regular dream pictures, with symbolical
meaning in great poetical visions, the description of
which sometimes fills over thirty pages in succession.

Thus everything is combined in this book which is
most thoroughly characteristic of Russia: the broadly
constituted nature, the proud frankness, and the radical
disposition to go to the end of the rope; strong
influences from foreign lands, and independent originality,
lively sense of reality down to the dry prose and
penetrating fanatical mysticism.

When the foreigner in Russia, after repeatedly asking
if this or that person is prominent, gifted, remarkably
interesting, or the like, and after continually receiving
a negative answer, at last demands impatiently, “Who,
then, in the whole world is gifted?” then it will happen
to him again and again to receive from the most
different directions the melancholy answer, “Tchernuishevski
was.”

He will understand this answer when he has read
attentively all that is accessible from the pen of this
great man, whose name they do not even dare to print
in Russia.

<chapter name="V">

<h2><small>V.</small></h2>

<sc>October</sc> 28, 1818, there was born in the department
of Orel, in an old noble (originally Tatar) family, the
man to whom, down to the very latest time, the cultured
classes in the German and Latin countries are indebted
for almost all they know of the inner life of the Slavic
races of our day.

No earlier Russian author has been read in Europe
like Iván Sergeyevitch Turgenief; he is to be regarded
rather as a cosmopolitan than as a Russian author.

He opened up to the European public a new world of
subjects, but he did not need the collateral interest which
his work gained for him thereby; for it is the artist and
not the describer of culture which Europe has admired
in him. Although he has hardly been read out of his
own country in his own language, he has everywhere,
even in those countries which possess the most taste,
been placed on a level with the best authors of the land.
He has been read everywhere in translations, which
necessarily distort or diminish the impression of his
superiority; but the perfection of his originality asserted
itself so strongly in the various more or less happy forms
in which his books were cast that any want of delicacy
and clearness was overlooked. Great authors, as a rule,
work most effectively through their style, because by
this they come into personal contact with the reader.
Turgenief made a very deep impression, although the
reader who was not a Russian could appreciate only the
coarser qualities of his style, and could scarcely imagine
with what elegance he was wont to express himself, and
would be just as far from understanding his allusions as
from being able to compare his interpretation and
description of persons and ways of thinking in Russia with
the reality from which they were taken. Turgenief
conquered in the artistic race, although he was heavily
handicapped; he was triumphant in the great arena,
although he wielded a sword without a point.

For the cultured people of Western Europe, he has
peopled the great empire of the East with human beings
of the present time. Thanks to him, we know the
spiritual characteristics of its men and women. Although
in the vigor of his age he left Russia, never again to
dwell in his native land, he has never described anything
else than the inhabitants of this country, and Germans
and Frenchmen only as half Russianized or even only in
contact with Russians. He only presents to us beings
with whose peculiarities he was familiar from his youth.
That gradually, during his long exile and the
estrangement which existed between the Slavophile and
European Russians, it came to be regarded as proper, in
certain Russian circles, to depreciate his knowledge of
his fatherland, and treat him as a kind of Western
European, was natural. But, if he had been a degree
less cosmopolitan, he certainly would never have made
his way into the whole civilized world as he has done.

He has given pictures from the forest and the steppes,
from spring and autumn, from all ranks and classes of
society, and all grades of culture, in Russia. He has
drawn the serf and the princess, the peasant and the
proprietor, and the student; the young girl who is pure
soul, endowed with the finest Slavic charms, and the
cold, beautiful, egotistical coquette, who in his hands
seems to be more irresponsible in her heartlessness than
anywhere else. He has given a rich psychology of a
whole human race, and has given it with a mind greatly
excited, but yet so that his mental agitations do not in
any way disturb the transparent clearness of the
descriptions.

Of all the prose writers of Russia, Turgenief is the
greatest artist. Possibly, it depends upon the fact that
he is the one of those who has lived most in foreign
lands; for if his long residence in France has not
increased the stock of poetry which he brought with him
from his home, yet he has plainly learned there the art
of setting his pictures in frame and glass.

A broad, deep wave of melancholy flows through
Turgenief’s thoughts, and therefore also through his
books. However sober and impersonal his style is, and
although he hardly ever inserts poems in his novels
and romances, still his general narrative makes a lyrical
impression. There is so much feeling condensed in
them, and this feeling is invariably sadness, — a peculiar,
wonderful sadness without a touch of sentimentality.
Turgenief never expresses himself wholly emotionally;
he works with restrained emotion; but no Western
European is sad as he is. The great melancholy authors of the
Latin races, like Leopardi or Flaubert, have harsh, firm
outlines in their style; the German sadness is glaringly
humorous or pathetic or sentimental. The melancholy
of Turgenief is, in its general form, that of the Slavic
races in their weakness and sorrow, which comes in a
direct line from the melancholy in the Slavic popular
ballads.

All the later Russian poets of rank are melancholy.
But with Turgenief it is the melancholy of the thinker
who has understood that all the ideals of the human
race — justice, reason, supreme goodness, happiness —
are a matter of indifference to nature, and never assert
themselves by their own spiritual power. In “Senilia,”
he has represented Nature as a woman, sitting clad in
wide green kirtle, in the middle of a hall in the depths
of the earth, lost in meditation.

“‘Oh, our common mother!’ he asks, ‘what art thou
thinking of? Is it on the future fate of the human
race? Is it on the necessary conditions for its reaching 
the highest possible perfection, the greatest possible
happiness?’

“The woman slowly turns her dark, piercing, dreadful
eyes towards me; her lips half opened and I heard a
voice which rang as when iron comes in contact with
iron.

“‘I am thinking how I can give the muscles of the
flea greater power so that it can more easily escape
from the persecutions of its enemies. There is no
equilibrium between the attack and defence: it must be
restored.’

“‘What!’ stammered I, ‘is it that you are thinking
of? But we, the human race, are we not your
children?’

“She wrinkled her eyebrows imperceptibly.

“‘All animals are my children,’ said she; ‘I care
equally for them all, and I exterminate them all in the
same manner.’”

Here you have his character of melancholy. When
Gogol is melancholy, it is because he is indignant; when
Dostoyevski is so, it depends upon the fact that he is
dissolved in sympathy with the ignorant and the obscure,
with the saint-like, noble, and pure of heart, and almost
even more with sinners both male and female; Tolstoï’s
melancholy has its root in his religious fatalism.
Turgenief alone is a philosopher.

It will also be found that the other great poets have
had a turning-point in their lives when they have been
seized by a religious excitement which has given a new
stamp to their career, according to their own
interpretation a new consecration and a new earnestness, but
which also operates greatly to hamper and diminish
their poetic descriptive powers, nay, generally a little
sooner or later it entirely destroys their poetic gifts.
This turning-point comes in some cases from an
independent conversion, and in others when they are filled
with a national or a national religious mysticism. The
disposition to such mysticism makes its appearance in
this century as a common Slavic trait. It attacked in
the Polish literature, in the forties, Mickiewicz, Slowacki,
Krasinski, Zaleski, and others when Towianski and other
dreamers made their influence felt. It has prevailed
in Russian literature, in different forms, with men of so
great ability as Gogol and Dostoyevski, and manifests
itself, last of all, with Tolstoï — as it would seem, under
the influence of Zhutayef.

Only for Turgenief, with his quiet contemplation,
even religious enthusiasm is a theme like any other,
although he, too, in “Clara Militch” and “The Love
Song of the Conquering Lovers,” pays his tribute to the
mystical. He treats religious enthusiasm without losing
his equilibrium. We recall, for instance, his Sophie
Vladimirovna from “A Strange Story,” the young girl
of good family, who accompanies a wandering saint out
into the wide world.

His melancholy, therefore, is less religious than
philosophical; but it is that of the patriot who has become a
pessimist. In spite of all his seeming cosmopolitanism,
he was a patriot, but a patriot who mourned over his
fatherland and despaired of it. He was attacked for
this. Dostoyevski tried to make him ridiculous in the
figure of Karmásinof in “The Possessed.” He did not,
indeed, lack confidence in the future of his fatherland;
he admired its language and certain parts of its
literature so much that he inferred therefrom what abilities
the people must possess who had produced such results.
But he did not share in the enthusiasm of his more
simple and ignorant countrymen for the Russian people as
such. He did not find their past history great.

Turgenief somewhere describes his dejection when at
one of the great world’s exhibitions he got an exact
perception of how insignificant Russia’s contribution
was to industrial inventions, and he added bitterly,
“We have invented nothing but the knout.” His
career as an author shows that the history of the more
recent development of his country was far from inspiring
him with confidence.

Iván Turgenief lost his father early (1834), Col. Sergeï
Nikolayevitch (of that Turgenief family which had
already given two distinguished men to Russia), and
suffered from the imperious and cold-hearted rule of
his mother. But he was brought up in country quiet,
on the family estate Spasskoye, and at an early age felt
the most vital love for nature as well as the most
passionate hatred to serfdom, whose unhappy results were
constantly before him.

He studied first at the University of Moscow and
then at that of St. Petersburg, travelled in 1838 to
Germany and like Katkóf and Bakunin listened to
lectures on philosophy and history at the University of
Berlin (by Michelet, Werder, Ranke, and others). After
several years’ residence in foreign lands he returned
home as a supporter of Western European liberal
thought, was given a position in the department of
the Minister of the Interior, but retired from the office
at the end of a year, to live the free life of a Russian
landed proprietor and huntsman.

He published his first hunting stories in 1847; then
followed from 1847 to 1851 the others, which in 1852
appeared collected as “Recollections of a Huntsman,” and
created an epoch-making sensation. He at first began
with things in verse like Byronisms and romanticisms,
unsuccessful and without originality. It was in this
first period that Alexander Herzen, as has been told me
by an eye-witness, called him so affected that he could
not eat without affectation. Byelinski tore him loose
from Byron, Heine, and the romanticists, and brought
him into the right path.

He expressed what he knew thoroughly: Russian
nature and the life of the Russian people, and gave
his hatred of serfdom expression in the forms which
the censor would allow. This certainly had a beneficial
effect on his talent, — developed, necessarily, everything
that was pre-eminent, aristocratic, and discreet in it. If
he sometimes, in his early youth, had an inclination to
the pathetic, to declamation, to glaring effects, —
pronounced it could have been under no circumstances, —
then the relation to the censor must have suppressed it.
To awaken a sympathy for the serfs, to show the lawlessness 
in which they passed their lives, and give pictures
of the roughness which abused them even to death, —
and that without making use of the whip or knout, — he
relates incidents in his life as a sportsman, visits to the
landed proprietors or to the physicians, and among these,
now and then, little stories: of the miller’s wife who, as
a girl, had been guilty of a black ingratitude in wishing
to marry, although her angelic mistress could not endure
married servants, and who, when she would not give up
her lover, was punished by a forced marriage to another,
after having seen her Petruchkha put into the army. Or
there is the story of the deaf and dumb but muscular
man-servant Gerassim, whose sweetheart his gracious
mistress married to a drunkard for her own amusement,
and who was compelled to drown his dog, a little,
emaciated puppy, Mumu, — his last consolation and sole
company in the world, — because sometimes his barking
irritated his mistress when, after too great indulgence at
her meals, she was lying sleepless.

Both stories are told without comment, with no
criticism of the events; the hatred of brutality which was
manifested is expressed only in irony, and this irony,
again, disappears in the pervading sadness.

What makes Turgenief’s vein so rich and peculiar is
that he is at once a pessimist and a philanthropist; that
he loved the race of which he thought so poorly and
esteemed so lightly.

But he had seen altogether too much go wrong and
miscarry in Russia to be able to narrate any other
incidents than those with unhappy or sad results. To him,
a love story is not genuine Russian if it does not have an
unhappy issue in consequence of the inconstancy of the
man or the coldness of the woman. An undertaking
does not seem to him to be genuine Russian unless it
is beyond the capacity of him who attempts it, and falls
through in consequence of the insusceptibility of those
for whose sake it was to be carried through. But still
he cannot refrain from dwelling again and again on
vacillating love and fruitless struggles in Russia. For him,
the land of Russia, where everything comes to grief, is a
land of general shipwreck. And his chief emotion is one
which awakens and is mingled with pain in the spectator
of a shipwreck, in which the latter must give the 
sufferers themselves the greatest part of the blame. There
is a strong and quiet emotion which is always softened in
its expression. It is seldom that a great and productive
author has made so little noise as he.

There is something aristocratic in this noble and
simple attitude. It is not that, like Lord Byron or Prince
Pückler, he has impressed the marks of superiority upon
his works by any external stamp. But the impression
forces itself upon us that the author has inherited his
intellectual refinement, and has always lived in the best
society. He was a man of the world, and we feel behind
his works the experience in life of a man of the world,
which the German authors generally lack. But this
experience has neither made him cynical, like so many
French authors, nor given to moralizing, like so many
English. Although he has never shown any lack of
good breeding in his style, still his tone is not the tone
of the world. Even his contempt is not a cold contempt.
There is always a soul in his voice.

It is difficult to say briefly and precisely what it is
which makes Turgenief an artist of the first rank. We
might almost say that it is because his style is so
genuine. But even this word needs an explanation. The
fact that he possesses in the highest degree the quality
of a true poet, of being able to create men who live,
is not all. What makes his artistic superiority so
perceptible is the harmony which the reader traces
between the author’s conception of the person who is
described, his opinion of him, and also the impression
which is made upon him as well as upon the reader by
that person.

The point is here. The relation of the author to his
own creations is such that every weakness which he has
as an artist or as a man must be exposed to the light.
The author may have many and rare gifts, but if he calls
upon us to admire that which is not worthy of admiration, 
or if he would extort from us admiration for a man,
or sympathy with a woman, or enthusiasm for an act,
without our feeling that there is any occasion for those
sentiments, then he has injured and weakened himself.
When the author of a novel, whose company we have
kept for a long time with pleasure, suddenly shows
himself less critical or more emotional or morally more lax
than we are, then his descriptions lose their point for us.
If he allows a person to appear as irresistibly winning,
without our finding him fascinating; if he draws a man
as more gifted or even more witty than he seems to us to
be; if he explains his conduct by a magnanimity we
have never met with, and in this case do not believe in;
if he defies us by arbitrary, immature judgments, or
disturbs us by coldness, or irritates us by moralizing: then
there steals in upon the reader more and more a feeling
of disappointing art. It is as if you heard a false note;
and even if the music is afterwards correct, the
disagreeable impression lingers in the mind. What reader of
Balzac, or Dickens, or Auerbach — to speak only of the
great dead — has not experienced this disagreeable
impression! When Balzac becomes enthusiastic over
vulgarity, or Dickens childishly pathetic, or Auerbach
affectedly simple, the reader feels that he is in the
presence of the untrue, the abortive, and is taken
aback. Nothing abortive is ever met with in Turgenief.

The subjects he has selected are all the most difficult.
He refuses to be interested in romantic characters and
marvellous adventures, and he no less refuses the
attractions of impurity. There seldom or never happens
anything unusual in his books — a catastrophe like the
falling-down of a house at the close of the “King Lear
of the Steppe” is purely exceptional — and although he
does not go out of his way on account of low and vile
characters, or of incidents which no English novelist
would relate, yet he does not dwell upon the obscene,
as those authors who once for all have disregarded
conventionality are so often tempted to do. As an artist
he was a decided realist, but a modest realist.

His chief domain as a narrator is the poor, the weak,
the inconstant and untrustworthy, the superfluous and
the abandoned.

He does not, like Dostoyevski, describe the misfortune
which is externally palpable, nor the poverty, the
roughness, the corruption, the crime, nor, above all, the
misfortune, which can be seen at a distance. He describes
the misfortune which avoids publicity, and he is
especially the author for those who have submitted to their
fate. He has pictured the inner life of reticent sorrow,
— the still-life of the unfortunate, so to speak.

For instance read “A Correspondence.” It is a young
girl with whom we gradually become acquainted, who
has lived isolated, misunderstood, despised by stupid
associates in a little country village, and who is on the
point of becoming an old maid. She has already resigned 
herself to it, deserted as she has been by her lover.
She has given up her demands on life, and is trying only
for peace and is on the way to success. Then begins —
from an impulse of communicativeness, of idleness, of
longing, of sympathy — a friend of her younger days
to write to her. At first she answers declining the
correspondence; after the receipt of other epistles she
allows permission for him to continue to be extorted
from her. He writes, and she replies, no longer briefly,
but in a long, eloquent letter. In this manner the
feeling of friendship grows up in her heart, and in no very
long time occupies it and passes over into love. They
are both in love for one short moment. He longs for
and worships her, the day of his starting and arrival is
already fixed; — then the correspondence is broken off,
he allows himself to be carried away by a ballet girl,
over whose vulgar graces he forgets everything, and she
sinks anew, but this time more deeply wounded, back to
her dreadful solitary life.

The highly elaborated novel “An Unfortunate Woman”
treats of the life of another young girl, whose
misfortune is equally quiet and uneventful. Her earliest
remembrance is that her mother, a Jewess, the daughter
of a foreign painter, and she herself sat daily at the
table of the landed proprietor Kaltovskoi. Kaltovskoi
is a grand old bugbear, who smelt horribly of ambergris,
continually took snuff out of a gold snuff-box, and
inspires the child with no other feeling than fear, even
when he holds qut his hard, dry hand, with lace cuffs,
for her to kiss. At the same time that the mother is
made to marry the disgusting steward Ratch, the child
learns that the landed proprietor is her father. The
father never speaks a loving word to her, and not even
once a kindly one; he accepts her with stiff grandeur, as
his little reader. The mother dies. The old, heartless
landed proprietor dies some years later. His brother
and heir, Semyón Matveitch, gives Susannah some money,
which her stepfather immediately appropriates.
Having grown up, her heart speaks for the first time; she
falls deeply in love with Semyón’s son, her cousin
Mikhaïl, an excellent young officer, who loves her as she
deserves to be loved. But no sooner is the intimacy of
the two discovered than they are ruthlessly separated.
Mikhaïl is sent away and dies immediately after. The
father, Semyón, pursues his young niece with 
dishonorable advances and proposals. At last he dies also and
leaves her an annuity, which her stepfather receives.
Three years — six, seven years pass<sp> ...</sp> time moves on.
She sees it gliding away indifferently and with it life.
Then a new ray of light falls into her existence; a fine
young man, whom she has won, also wins her interest;
then he hears from her associates, from her own depraved
step-brother even, the most scurvy calumnies in regard
to her past history, and draws back. She takes poison.

Or read “The Diary of a Superfluous Man.” The
title explains the contents. It is a man who is mortally
ill, and who occupies his last days in recording the chain
of common events which has made up his useless life.
He has from first to last been in the way in the world.
Once he fell in love, but only to suffer all the pangs of
jealousy, and experience all its humiliations. Elizabeth
did not love him, but a dazzling young prince from
St. Petersburg, who is stopping for a short time in the
provincial town in which she dwells. He challenges the
prince, who spares him in the duel, succeeds only in
passing for a bad man, and appearing to the object of
his affections as a murderer. Even when the prince
seduces and abandons Elizabeth, and when, nevertheless,
he is ready again to ask for her hand, her aversion to
him is unchanged. She gives her hand to another not
less magnanimous friend, who has got the start of the
unhappy lover, and who thus even on this occasion
makes him a superfluity. Here as always the poor
fellow has been the fifth wheel to the coach. And yet
we feel, through every line, how full of feeling, how
nobly endowed and good he is. The last pages of the
diary contain the farewell to life of the consumptive,
who has been given up by his physician.

“Jacob Passinkof” is another story of the same kind.
Passinkof belongs to the type of Russian personalities
which Turgenief describes with partiality. He is not
specially noble in his exterior, tall, thin,
round-shouldered, and his nose even a little red. But his forehead
is magnificent, his voice mild and subdued, and, as it is
significantly enough said of him, “In his mouth the
words goodness, truth, life, knowledge, love sound
always like phrases, however enthusiastically he utters
them.” In his story Turgenief’s fundamental theme
comes out in a double form. He is in love with a
beautiful young girl, who does not give him a thought.
When he dies, forgotten and alone in an obscure corner
of Siberia, he still has some mementos of her on his
breast. He needed some faults, some selfishness, some
levity, to win her favor. In the mean time, as a requital,
without his knowing it, he was silently loved by her plain,
rather ugly and awkward sister, who has always kept him
faithfully in mind, and who for his sake had never been
willing to marry.

Turgenief’s story, written somewhat late in life, “The
Living Relic,” is certainly the best specimen of these
monographs of misfortune, which are just as fine and
perfect as they are simple. It is almost an unadorned
soliloquy; it is only the account of her life which a
young, formerly beautiful Russian peasant girl, now
worn to a skeleton, gives to the author. He finds her
lying on her back, after a fateful fall, and she has been
lying thus for nearly seven years. Her head is emaciated, 
sallow as bronze; her nose sharp and pointed as a
knife-blade; her lips sunken in, only the teeth and the
white of her eyes have any lustre; some tufts of thin,
flaxen yellow hair fall down over her forehead. Outside
of the bed-clothing were lying a pair of very small
hands whose fingers, like little dark brown pins, move
slowly to and fro. And once she was the most plump,
most graceful, gayest, and most beautiful girl in the
country, always ready for laughter, song, and dance.
She tells her fate, how after her accident she had
become shrunken, dark-colored, had lost the power of
standing and walking, appetite for eating and drinking;
how they burnt her on the back with red-hot iron, and
put her into solid ice, all to no effect. And she tells all
this in an almost cheerful manner, without any attempt
to excite pity. Her lover has left her, and married
another. He is, she says, happy in his marriage, thank
God. She finds his act natural and right. She is thankful 
to the people who take care of her, especially to a
little girl who brings her flowers; she is not dull, does
not complain: there are others who are more unhappy
than she is, — the blind or the deaf and dumb; she sees
wonderfully well, and hears everything, — hears when
a mole is digging under ground, and smells every
fragrance, even the weakest, — the flowers of the
buckwheat, far out in the fields, and the linden trees far
down in the garden. The great events in her existence
are when a hen or a sparrow or a butterfly comes in to
her through a door or window. She has great pleasure
in the recollection of a visit a hare made to her one
day. And Lukeria reminds Turgenief of the time when
she sang ballads. She still sings them sometimes, she
tells him. The thought that this scarcely living being
is preparing to sing inspires him with involuntary horror;
and, trembling like a thread of light smoke, her poor
little voice comes out in almost inaudible but clear and
pure tones. She tells him the wonderful dreams she has
had (unfortunately she sleeps but little), — one about
Jesus, who came to meet her, and held out his hand to
her; one about a woman whom she met, and who was
her death, but who went past her, and, pitying her, did
not complain that she could not take her with her. She
contradicts the author when he expresses his admiration
of her patience. What is there to admire! What has
she done! No, the maiden who, in a distant country,
with a great sword drove the enemy out into the sea,
and then said, “Burn me now, for it was my promise
that I would die at the stake for my people!” — that
maiden performed a wonderful act. As he went away,
Lukeria begs him to say a word for the peasants there
in the village at her mother’s, so that they might obtain
a little bit of an abatement in the rent. She needs
nothing herself, and has nothing to wish for in her own
behalf.

Still it is not these minor works which have made
Turgenief’s name renowned throughout the world. It
is his greater novels, his few romances, masterpieces,
like “On the Eve” (Helen), “Rudin,” “Spring Floods,”
“Smoke,” “Fathers and Sons,” and “Virgin Soil.” No
more subtile psychology is to be found in European
literature, no more perfect delineation of character, and,
what is almost unseen in the history of modern authorship, 
the figures of the men and women are here equally
perfect.

In order fully to understand these best works of
Turgenief, it is necessary to have some knowledge of his
life and character.

Two decisive events occurred in his life. The first is
his imprisonment and subsequent banishment to his
estate in 1842. The second is his acquaintance with
Mme. Pauline Viardot, <i>née</i> Garcia.

In the government circles a suspicious watch was kept
on Turgenief, on account of his attacks on serfdom.
Then, when Gogol died, and Turgenief, in a newspaper
article (in which the censor in Moscow found nothing to
strike out), eulogized the deceased with warm words, they
at once seized upon the opportunity to give him a blow.
They found — Heaven knows how — disobedience towards 
the Tsar in the said article, and on “the command 
of the highest of all” he was thrown into prison
in St. Petersburg. Among his letters is to be found a
communication which he wrote to the heir-apparent
(Alexander) to prove his innocence. After having
passed a month in prison, which the delicate condition
of his health made doubly painful to him, he was exiled
to his estate Spasskoye, where he was obliged to remain
for several years. It is plainly enough this event which
after his pardon led him to take up his permanent
residence outside of his native land.

The acquaintance with Mme. Viardot imprisoned the
author near to her for all the rest of his life — far more
than half. She was born in Paris in 1821 and had made
extensive artistic tours in America and Europe with her
parents, first as a pianist and then as a vocalist. Her
first appearance in Paris, which happened at the same
time as Rachel’s, is commemorated in verse by Alfred
de Musset. From 1840 she was the wife of the author
Louis Viardot. As early as 1847, Turgenief accompanied
the married couple to Berlin and then to Paris. From
1856 he is to be regarded as a member of the Viardot
family, and the influence which the mistress of the
house exerted upon the author was great, and, so far as
can be perceived, only for good. In 1847, when his
despotic mother refused to send him any money for his
support, Mme. Viardot assisted him out of her own
purse, and it was therefore only just that Turgenief in
his will should have made her his residuary legatee, —
which, however, has given rise to many fiendish
comments on the part of Russians.

Turgenief’s relation to Mme. Viardot was that of
passionate devotion and admiration. He could not do
without her, and took counsel with her about his affairs
of every description. Genuine Slav as he was, susceptible 
to impressions, intellectually productive and almost
destitute of will-power, he was fortunate in having a
fair ruler over his life. When any friend complained to
him of his own irregular and unfortunate career, he
usually answered: “Do as I do, my dear fellow; I
allow myself to be ruled.” He did what Mme. Viardot
told him he ought to do, and was contented therewith.

She seems to have been the only woman of importance 
in his life. Naturally, he had known women in
his youth. At the age of nineteen, in Berlin, he was
the friend of a little sewing-girl and was chagrined that
Bakunin, with whom he was living, could tell by his
looks when he had been to see her.<footnote>Isaac Pavlovsky: <i>Souvenirs de Tourguéneff</i>, p. 112 and following.</footnote> At first in the
beginning of the fifties he lived in Russia, and then,
1851-53, with a Russian serf, Avdotya Yermolayevna
Ivánova, who must have been very beautiful, but to
whom it appeared to be impossible to impart the
mysteries of the art of reading. She bore to him, in 1842,
the daughter whom he married to a Frenchman in 1864.
His letters show that he did not at that time even know
where the mother, who had married a Russian official,
was living. (Letter to Maslof, December 26, 1864.)
But he was a good father as well as a faithful friend
and a magnanimous protector.

His character was noble; refined and pure even to the
point of tenderness; but gentle and undecided.
Probably he was not obliged to go far, as a young man, to
find the model of single traits of character in Rúdin. He
was never guilty of any low act; but, on the other hand,
he hardly ever acted with any bold and forcible energy.
In reading his letters we are surprised to see with what
rascals he corresponded, — apparently not to make
enemies of them, — and with how little respect he speaks in
confidential letters of persons to whom in other letters
he shows great regard. When we find that Turgenief,
with a character in which will-power was so weakly
developed, during the whole of his life remained
inviolably faithful to the old liberal convictions of his youth,
we can scarcely err in attributing to Mme. Viardot no
small degree of honor for this result. If she had
influenced him in the opposite direction, he would probably
have become conservative, and if her house and circle
had not been decidedly liberal, perhaps an influence from
some other direction would have succeeded in swaying
him. On the contrary, he seems to have been entirely
independent in his obstinate position as the exponent
and pupil of Western Europe.

In perfect accord with the weak appearance of his
will-power in Turgenief’s character is the circumstance
that as an author he comes forward with a confidence
like that of a somnambulist. He said to Mikhaïlof,
Professor of Physiology in St. Petersburg (from whom I
have it): “I see a man who strikes me from some characteristic 
or other, perhaps of little importance. I forget
him. And then, long after, the man suddenly starts up
from the grave of forgetfulness. About the characteristic 
which I observed, others group themselves, and it is
of no use now if I want to forget him: I cannot do it;
he has taken possession of me; I think with him, live
in him; I can only restore myself to ease by finding
an existence for him.”

Turgenief, as a writer, is more elegant than forcible.
It is for that reason that female characters are so well
adapted to his talents.

With trailquil tenderness he draws the young girls
who have his full sympathy, Helen and Gemma, and with
an indulgent love which, nevertheless, excludes all praise
and admiration on the part of the author. Every word
which is said of them is determinative, limiting. One,
in play of features, gestures, laughter, train of ideas and
love is wholly Italian; the other is impressed on the
mind of the reader as the most beautiful type of Russian
womanhood. Only the best authors of the world have
produced anything so natural, so well sustained. And
the worship of beauty that is to be found there has done
no harm to the study of nature. They are not women
whom the author has arbitrarily created, and who dwell
in the fancy-land of poetry, like the forms of women in
the works of so many other authors. They are not
products of Turgenief’s personal enthusiasm for the
womanly, not merely an expression of his ideal alone,
but studies built up on a foundation of a delicate sense
of reality, and by the force of a thorough knowledge of
the real.

In the more important male characters, from the
nature of the material, Turgenief found his task
especially difficult. While the chief aim of an author
usually is to sustain his characters and let them escape
self-contradiction, the finest characters of Turgenief
are made up of contradictions. He understood how to
treat inconsistency as a fundamental trait of
character without having the character disorganized thereby.
With the regular Russian, as he describes him, there is
nothing certain to be depended upon except instability.
As Alexis, in “A Correspondence,” leaves Maria in the
lurch, so Rúdin abandons Natalia, Sanin, in “Spring
Floods,” Gemma, Litvinof, in “Smoke,” Tatyana, etc.;
they abandon youth, freshness, goodness of heart, beauty,
happiness, to run after intoxication of the senses and
degradation, or they deceive from pure weakness and
instability in themselves. And to these men, whom no
one can trust, and whose sudden outbursts of passion
and sudden cessation thereof surprise themselves not
less than others, correspond women on whom it is just
as impossible to depend, women who are on the point of
being able to love, but cannot, like Marie Odinzof, in
“Fathers and Sons;” women who unintentionally
insnare, abandon themselves, draw back, like Iriona in
“Smoke;” and, finally, cold Bacchantes, like that Maria
Nikolayevna who carries away Sanin from Gemma.

Sometimes, the inconsistency and treachery remain
rather unsatisfactorily explained, as in “Spring Floods;”
in that case, it depends upon the fact that Turgenief
assumes, so to speak, that this trait of character of
his young men is known. In his earliest great novel,
“Rúdin” (1855), the study of inconsistency is so
thorough and exhaustive that, through the weakness of this
one character, we understand the weakness of the
Russian character everywhere. That which most excites
our admiration for the skill of the artist in this, is that
he has been able to awaken a no small degree of
sympathy for Rúdin; that in the milksop and phrase-monger
he has shown us the sincere enthusiast. Rúdin, who
speaks so warmly, tells a story so fascinatingly, and
possesses all “the music of eloquence,” is lazy, despotic,
everlastingly playing a part, forever living at the
expense of others, cold when he seems to be warmest,
intellectually weak when he seems to be about to
accomplish something. And yet Turgenief shows that he
deserves our pity far more than our ill will, and that he
rightfully exerts a great influence on young souls.

Men with constant hearts and strong wills do not
appear among Turgenief’s leading figures in his younger
days. They are Hamlets who descend from Pushkin’s
Onyegin and Herzen’s Beltov. When he describes a man
who is wholly a man, and to whom a woman can look
up, then, as in “Helen,” in order to shame his
countrymen, he chooses a foreigner, the Bulgarian Insarof, who
has exactly those qualities which the Russians, from the
best to the poorest, lack. The model of the figure was a
real Bulgarian, Katianof, who has figured in his native
land, and with whom Turgenief (1855) became acquainted
through the papers of a neighboring landed proprietor,
Karateyef. Otherwise, men whom Turgenief himself
admires are named only incidentally, and they are placed
as figures in the background, or used as contrasts to
bring out the falsity and weakness of the leading
character. Such, for instance, is Pokorski in “Rúdin,” of
whom Lekhnef speaks with so fascinating an enthusiasm, 
and in whom we really may see a portrait of the
critic Byelinski, the friend and teacher of Turgenief’s
youth, to whose memory he has dedicated “Fathers and
Sons,” and by whose side he, on his death-bed, expressed
his desire to be buried. It is said of him: —

“Pokorski made the impression of a very quiet and
gentle, almost weak nature; he loved women to madness,
enjoyed a little dissipation, and would not have suffered
an insult of any kind whatever. Rúdin appeared to be
all fire and flame, life, boldness, but at the bottom of his
soul he was cold and almost a coward, so long as his
vanity was not wounded, for then his self-control would
be entirely destroyed by his frenzy. He continually
sought to be the master of others<sp> ...</sp> but acquiesced in
bearing his yoke, but Pokorski submitted to all
voluntarily<sp> ...</sp> oh, it was a beautiful time and I cannot
believe that it was wasted. How often have I not met
people from that time, my former comrades, men who
seemed to have sunken into a purely animal existence, —
and yet it was only necessary to mention Pokorski’s
name; immediately all the good that had survived in
them rose to the surface, as when one in a dirty, dark
room opens a bottle of perfume which has been forgotten
there.”

Yet it was not until the publication of “Fathers and
Sons” in 1861 that Turgenief gave a typical representation 
of the strong character and intellectual superiority
of the Russian, this time in its modern form. The
character of Bazárof introduced “nigilism” into light
literature. Even if Turgenief has apparently specially
desired to strike a blow against the idolization of simple
utility, with its poverty of ideas, in the younger
generation, still he has succeeded in drawing a man who by
his firmness, his courage, and his steadfastness, towers
up in the whole of European literature, which is not
rich in types of true men. It cannot have escaped the
observation of any one tolerably familiar with modern
books that it is as if true manhood had disappeared. A
man who has a will and mind and uses his will to aid
his mind, sticks to his aim, is a support to his friends,
is an everlasting thorn in the flesh to his enemies, and to
whom the women, the defenceless, the beginners in life,
naturally gravitate, such a man comes no more to the
front, save in the dilute romances of boys and ladies.

In 1860, on a journey in Germany in a railway carriage, 
Turgenief met a young Russian physician, who,
in the brief conversation that took place between them,
astonished him by his original and startling views. He
gave the poet the idea of Bazárof. In order to familiarize 
himself with the character, Turgenief began to
keep “Bazárof’s Diary,” that is, as soon as he read a
new book or met a person who interested him or exhibited 
some characteristic of a political or social nature,
he criticised him in this diary according to Bazárof’s
manner of thought.

As is well known, it was not so much by the genius
which was displayed in the delineation of the principal
character as it was from the effect the work created, the
ill will, the misunderstandings, the passionate attacks, it
provoked on the part of the radical leaders, that “Fathers
and Sons” was an event in the history of Russian literature 
and in the author’s own life. The book is a masterpiece 
without a blemish, besides being the original
prototype of all the modern novels in different countries
which treat of an older and younger generation in their
reciprocal relations and conflicts; but in the beginning
nothing else was seen in it than the depreciation of the
younger generation to the advantage of the culture of
the older.

In the face of this stupidity, Turgenief's own utterances 
about the hero have an increased interest. A
certain Slutchevski had upbraided him that Bazárof
had made so unfavorable an impression. He answers
(1862): “Nevertheless, Bazárof drives all the other
persons of the novel into the background<sp>....</sp> He is honest,
upright, and a democrat of the purest water. And you
find in him no good quality! He commends ‘Force and
Matter’ by name as a popular, that is a worthless book.
The duel with Pavel Petróvitch is introduced to
represent the intellectual vacuity of the elegant, noble
knighthood; it is even then almost overdrawn, ridiculously
represented<sp>....</sp> According to my view, Bazárof is
constantly Pavel Petróvitch wholly superior and unconverted. 
When he calls himself a ‘nihilist,’ we must read
revolutionist<sp>....</sp> On the one side a venal official, on the
other an ideal youth. Such pictures I leave for others
to draw; I strove for something greater<sp>....</sp> I close
with the remark: If the reader does not find Bazárof
dear to him in spite of all his coarseness, heartlessness,
merciless dryness and sharpness, — then the fault is
mine and I have missed my mark. But sweet with
syrup — to speak after the manner of Bazárof — that I
would not have, although I had immediately won the
youth over to my side thereby.”

And twelve years later, after a fresh attack, he turns
back again to his tenderness for Bazárof. He writes:
“What! you also contend that I caricatured youth in
Bazárof. You repeat this — pardon the freedom of the
expression — insane complaint. Bazárof, my favorite
child, for whose sake I broke with Katkóf, and on whom
I lavished all the colors I could command! Bazárof,
this intelligent man, this hero, a caricature!” <sp>...</sp><footnote>Briefe von J. S. Turgenjev, Uebersetzt von H. Ruhe, 1886, i. 96
and following, 214 and following.</footnote>

By the novel “Smoke,” Turgenief fell out with
another not less influential group in Russia than that
which had been so much offended by “Fathers and
Sons.” It was almost a blow aimed at the Slavophiles,
and imbittered them in every case against him. Katkóf
and Dostoyevski were from this time his bitter enemies
and persecutors. In this book certain twaddling and
conceited Russian quasi-reformers are thrown aside with
a cutting scorn, which recalls to a denizen of the North
Henrick Ibsen’s manner of treating certain reformers
among his countrymen.

But in “Virgin Soil” (1877), Turgenief’s last great
work and the most versatile he wrote, he has brought
his criticism of society to an end with a thorough
unpartisan justice, by exposing to sun and air ranks, families,
tendencies, and races in his great native land. “Virgin
Soil” is inferior to the older, larger novels to the extent
that here for the first time we feel clearly that the
author has lived for a long time out of Russia, making
up for the lack of personal observation by reading
newspapers and legal reports; and still this book is the
richest and most complete expression of Turgenief’s
humanity and worldly wisdom, and of his love of
freedom and truth.

Here, perhaps in the most positive manner, his filial
affection for Russia, his appreciation of the Russian
youth, is brought to light; here appears unveiled his
vision of its high idealism. It is quite true that
everything miscarries here. With Turgenief all exertions
miscarry; upon the whole, everything meets with
misfortune. For the moment only hopelessness rules. The
older generation, with the liberalism of Sipjaegin, is
once for all given up; in the younger generation, there
is much that is well meant, much is disinterestedly
carried into effect, but all is fruitless. Nezhdanof wants
to go out among the people, wants to distribute
pamphlets among the peasants. It has the force of a
symbol that the peasants misunderstand him. They will
only drink with him; and the apostle of the common
people is carried home dead-drunk. It was not
without cause that Nezhdanof had previously finished his
poem, “The Sleep,” with this picture never to be
forgotten : —

“With a glass of spirit in thy hand, with head leaning
against the North Pole, with feet pressed against
Caucasus, oh, fatherland! Thus thou sleepest, holy Russia,
deeply and soundly and steadily.”

And yet in this last work a future is to be seen in
vague, distant outlines. Young women like Marianne
and Maschurin, young men like Markelof, like Solomin,
like Nezhdanof even, prepared the way for it.

The last twenty years of his life Turgenief passed
alternately in the two countries, Germany and France,
to which he was most indebted for his culture. He
lived in Baden-Baden and Paris. His relations to
Germany and France were, however, quite different.
Probably on account of ancient Russian tradition, and besides
in consequence of the nationality of Mme. Viardot, he
was far more closely bound to France than to Germany.
He had studied in Berlin, and the criticism of young
Hegelianism had refined and stimulated his mind. But,
although he worshipped Goethe as the master above all
others, and for a while in his youth was wholly absorbed
in Heine, although he continued to have friendly
relations with German authors and writers like Paul Heyse,
Ernst Dohn, and Ludwig Pietsch, spoke the language
fluently, and knew how to value the scientific greatness
of Germany, — in spite of all these bonds binding him
to that country, the Germans in his books, as in almost
all Russian romances and novels, are continually
represented in a highly satirical, and now and then even in
a hateful light. It is a weakness of German criticism
that it has not been able to see this evident fact. It is
true enough, as a general rule, that all nations describe
others without enthusiasm. A Russian woman, as drawn
by Victor Cherbuliez or Paul Heyse (<i>Ladislaus Bolski</i>,
“In Paradise,” <i>Das Glück zu Rothenburg</i>), never has
the good part. But there seems to have been a remnant
of national hate at the bottom of Turgenief’s soul.

Although, on the other hand, he did not fail to have
an eye to the deficiencies in the French culture, he
conducted himself in an entirely different manner in regard
to it. He felt that his art was wholly understood and
appreciated in that Paris which is otherwise so full of
prejudice towards foreigners. He had equally warm
admirers among those of the same age as himself
(Mérimée), those of a little younger generation (Augier,
Taine, Flaubert, Goncourt), and among the youngest
authors (Zola, Daudet, Maupassant). With that circle
of authors of which Flaubert was the centre, he
associated on a friendly and brotherly footing as with the
writers of no other land.

His relations to his own country were fluctuating.
In his younger days he was popular and then a subject of
hatred. It was first seen on his last visit to Russia that
the misunderstanding — that he should have abandoned
the ideals of his youth — had given way to a better
understanding, and his journey became a kind of
triumphal tour through the ovations which he received from
the youth. It is true that these ovations created such
uneasiness on the part of the government, that it
shortened his stay in St. Petersburg. In Moscow, where
Katkóf had attacked him as hostile to his fatherland
and seditious, a festival had been arranged for him, to
which Dostoyevski also was invited, his more recent,
spiteful appearance against Turgenief having been
overlooked on account of the convictions of his youth and his
martyrdom.

In the mean time, the more the younger generation
was reconciled to the author of “Fathers and Sons,” and
the more warmly he was greeted, the more the dissatisfaction 
of the Russian government with him increased.
This was also very clearly shown at his death. A
solemn funeral, with his house decorated, a long procession
and addresses at the grave were forbidden. In perfect
quiet, as if he were a convict, the man was buried who,
in these later days, had given the widest reputation to
the name of Russia.

For in the last ten years of his life, at least, he could
have rejoiced in an admiration which was equally
reverential over the whole of the civilized world.

Did he rejoice at it? I believe not. It affected him
agreeably, but he did not delight in it, and it did not
disperse his melancholy. Edmond de Goncourt relates
of Turgenief, that at a dinner given by Flaubert, in
March, 1872, during a moment of despondency, which
sometimes seizes upon a circle of friends who are
getting on towards old age, he allowed himself to be carried
away so far as to say: “You know that there is sometimes 
found in a room an odor of musk which cannot be
driven out; so it seems to me that about my person,
and that continually, there is a perfume of dissolution,
annihilation, death.” His last works, the charming and
original novel “Clara Militch," which is a variation of
the theme of his youth, disappointed love, and his
admirable collection of prose poems, “Senilia,” likewise
contain a deeper melancholy than the works of his youth,
save that a lyrical, fantastic element most poetically
flashes through them. Here, for the last time, he stands
face to face with the secret of life, and explains it in
unceasing sadness in symbols and visions. Nature is
hard and cold; then let man not neglect to love. There
is a scene here where Turgenief, on a solitary journey
from Hamburg to London, sits by the hour with a
poor, cowed, fettered little monkey’s hand in his — the
genius, whose spirit had ransacked the universe, hand
in hand with the little anthropoid animal, like two
kindred mortals, two children of the same mother, — there
is here more true devotion than in any book of devotion.

At the last, Turgenief seems to have had a strong
impression of man’s ingratitude. No one who has read
“Senilia” will ever forget “The Feast in Heaven.” All
the virtues were invited, and the virtues only; no men
were invited, only ladies. Many virtues came, small
and great. The small virtues were more agreeable and
more modest than the great; but all seemed to be
well contented and talked kindly to each other, as is
becoming for those who are akin. Then the good God
observed two beautiful ladies who did not seem to be
acquainted with each other. The master of the house
took one of the ladies by the hand and led her to the
other, and he introduced: Charity — Gratitude.

It was the first time since the creation of the world
that the two had met.

What sadness in the wit and what bitterness!

It also occurs to me that my gratitude towards this
great benefactor has its first expression when he can no
longer be sensible of any thanks.

<h2><small>VI.</small></h2>

<sc>In</sc> contrast to the national pessimism in Turgenief
stands the national optimism in Dostoyevski. The great
sceptic Turgenief, who believed in so little, believed in
the culture of Western Europe. Dostoyevski despised
the Occident, and believed in Russia. If the works of
Turgenief are, to some extent, to be regarded as emigrant
literature, then we stand with Dostoyevski wholly on
Russian soil; he is the autochthonic author, “the true
Scythian,” the legitimate barbarian without a drop of
classic blood in his veins.

Look at this countenance! half the face of a Russian
peasant, half the physiognomy of a criminal, with
flattened nose, small, piercing eyes, under eyelashes which
tremble with nervousness, long, thick, untidy beard, and
light hair; add to this the forehead of a thinker and a
poet, large and shapely, and the expressive mouth,
which, even when closed, speaks of tortures without
number, of ingulfing sadness, of unhealthy desires,
enduring pity, sympathy, passionate envy, anxiety,
torture! Look at this body, which is nothing but nerves,
small and slender, round-shouldered, and tenacious of
life, from his youth up subject to epileptic fits and
hallucinations! This exterior, at first sight plain and
vulgar, on closer examination stamped with weird genius,
thoroughly morbid and wholly extraordinary, speaks of
Dostoyevski’s epileptic genius, of the depths of mildness
which filled his soul, of the billows of almost insane
acuteness which frequently mounted into his head;
finally of that ambition which creates greatness in its
efforts, and the envy which creates smallness in the
soul.

It is a character which reminds one of Rousseau’s,
irritable and suspicious, with fits of depression and the
most exalted flights. Although his family belonged to
the lower ranks of nobility of Russia, from which the
subordinate officials are generally taken, he has, like
Rousseau, a thoroughly democratic stamp. Moreover,
even if he is fanatical in his ideas, like Rousseau, he
differs from him in his profound spiritual characteristics.
Rousseau is a deist, but, in spite of his sentimentality,
not a Christian, an enemy of the Christian humility, and
of all submission to fate. Dostoyevski, on the contrary,
— entirely regardless of the fact whether his dogmatic
faith was orthodox or not, — is in his whole emotional
nature the typical Christian. His works constitute a true
repertory of characters and conditions of thought
conceived from a Christian standpoint. All his persons are
invalids, sinners or saints, of both sexes, and the
transition from sinner to a convert, from fair sinner to fair
saint, and from the bodily sick to the spiritually sound,
happens, now after a slow purification, and now at a
flash, as in the New Testament; nay, often the fair
sinner is at the same time a fair saint, and the
greatest criminal just as near being worthy of admiration
as he is near being a scoundrel.

Physiologically and psychologically, all these types of
paupers and poor fellows, of the ignorant good-hearted,
of the simple emotional, of noble Magdalens, of the
nervously distracted, of those seized with frequent
hallucinations, of gifted epileptics, of enthusiastic seekers after
martyrdom, are just the same types as prevailed
centuries ago.

Feodor Mikhaïlovitch Dostoyevski was born in
October, 1821, in a hospital for the poor, in Moscow, where
his father was physician. There was a large family of
children, and small means. Feodor and his brother
Aleksei, to whom he was bound through life by an
intimate friendship and common literary interests, were
sent to the military school for engineers in St.
Petersburg, and left it as sub-lieutenants. But, after the
lapse of a year (1844), Feodor asked for his discharge
from the military service, to devote himself to literature.
He was even then suffering from the disease which was
aggravated when he was subsequently whipped in
Siberia; he had epileptic fits, and moreover he was
visionary. With regard to the subjects which he treated later,
and his ability to express the psychology of crime, this
saying of his to a friend is characteristic: “The
dejection which succeeds my epileptic attacks has this
characteristic, — I feel like a great criminal; it comes over
me like an unknown fault; a criminally guilty deed
weighs upon my conscience.”

At the age of twenty-four he wrote his novel “Poor
Folk.” Towards the close of his life, in the “Diary of
an Author” he related the circumstances of his first
appearance as an author. When he had written his novel,
and did not know how he should get his manuscript
disposed of, he got one of his friends, the subsequently
well-known author Grigoróvitch, to take it to the poet
Niekrásof. About three o’clock in the morning,
Dostoyevski heard some one knock at his door. It was
Grigoróvitch, who had come back with Niekrásof, who
had already read the novel, and was so struck by it that
he felt an impulse immediately to press the author to
his heart. When early the next morning he left
Dostoyevski, he went with the manuscript straight to
Byelinski, “the oracle of Russian thought, the critic
whose bare name frightened debutants.” — “A new
Gogol has arisen,” shouted Niekrásof, as he broke in
through the door. “Certainly, they shoot up nowadays
like toadstools,” answered Byelinski, fretfully, and
reluctantly looked into the manuscript. But the effect on
him was the same as on Niekrásof. When the author
visited him, he said to him enthusiastically: “Young as
you are, do you yourself understand how true it is what
you have written? I don’t think so. But true artistic
inspiration is there. Respect the gifts you possess, and
you will become a great author.”

In order to understand this astonishment and this
enthusiasm, we must remember that the Russian
literature even now does not possess a single attempt of this
kind except Gogol’s “Cloak,” and that Turgenief’s
“Recollections of a Huntsman” did not appear till five
years later. When a month or two after Byelinski’s
conversation with Dostoyevski “Poor Folk” (1846) issued
from the press, the author’s literary reputation was at
once established.

The uneasiness and versatility of his nature is
displayed in the circumstance that though he had made his
début in a direction which is like that into which
Dickens struck a little earlier, he continued his career
with worthless and comic novels in Paul de Kock’s
manner.

He was an inordinate reader at an early day. At the
age of twelve he had already ploughed through Karamzin
and Walter Scott, histories and historical novels by the
quantity. Reading exhausted him, nervous, irritable,
timid, emotional, precocious as he was, and with an
unusual gift of placing himself in the imagined situation.
In the School for Engineers, he read Balzac with special
zeal, being carried away by "Père Goriot," which in its
whole intellectual character furnishes one of the theories
of his own novels, and translated “Eugénie Grandet,”
occupied himself in addition very much with George
Sand and Eugène Sue, Dickens and Hoffman, the influence 
of all of whom is perceptible in his works. In this
first period of his youth Dostoyevski was still a prey to
varied influences.

He has himself told in his later years how Byelinski
at the close of the forties drew him on to socialism, and,
as he called it, tried to convert him to atheism. The
same hatred and the same ingratitude towards the men
who influenced his youth, Herzen, Byelinski, and others,
which found its expression in the novel “The Demons”
is shown in this bitter and poisonous attempt to cast the
blame of his youthful conviction upon a man who is
dead. We must remember that it is an old re-actionist
who speaks, and in his defence consider that Dostoyevski
was a man abused by life.

On the 23d of April, 1849, at five o’clock in the
morning, he, together with thirty-three other young men, was
arrested.

He had then for some time continuously belonged to
the circle which had established itself around a certain
Petrashevski, an adherent of the system of Fourier; in
the meetings of this circle the talk had been loud and
imprudent. The leader was a genuine Fourierist, an
enemy of gods and kings, an opponent of marriage and
property in the predominant forms. The indictment of
Dostoyevski himself was to this effect: Participation in
the meetings of the circle, observations about the
strictness of the censorship, reading or listening to the
reading of prohibited pamphlets, and finally promises of
possible aid in the establishment of a printing-office.

The accused were taken to the castle and isolated in
the casemates. They were there eight months without
any other amusements than their examinations by the
magistrate. It was not until towards the end of their
time of imprisonment that they were furnished with
some books of devotion. The poor poet, who was
reduced to the necessity of communing with his own
thoughts alone, felt as if he had been under an air
pump.

December 22, twenty-one of the accused who had
been found guilty were taken out to Semenovski Place,
where a scaffold had been erected. With the thermometer
at —15° Fahr. they were compelled to strip to their shirts
to listen to the reading of the sentence. This reading
occupied a half-hour. When it began the perpetually
optimistic Dostoyevski turned to his neighbor and said:
“Can it be possible that they are going to execute us?”
Instead of answering, the person to whom the inquiry
was addressed pointed to some objects, which were
concealed under the coverings of the wagons and which
looked like coffins. The sentence ended with the words,
<sp>“ ...</sp> are condemned to be shot.” A priest with a
crucifix in his hand now came forward and urged the
prisoners to confess. They refused with a single
exception. They then fastened Petrashevski and two others
of the leaders to the stake. An officer directed his
company to load their guns and wait for the word of
command. At this moment a white flag was waved and it
was announced to the condemned that the Tsar had
commuted their punishment. At the foot of the scaffold
sledges were waiting which were to carry them to Siberia.
Dostoyevski was sentenced to ten years hard labor. But
his punishment was changed later to four years in the
house of correction, and four years service as a soldier in
the ranks with loss of his rank as a noble and his rights
as a citizen. In Tobolsk the ways of the prisoners
separated; they said farewell to each other. Their feet were
fettered, their heads shaved, and they were sent to their
several places of destination.<footnote>De Voguë: <i>Le Roman Russe</i>, p. 218 and following.</footnote>

What Dostoyevski saw, felt, lived through, and
suffered in the Siberian House of Correction among the
dregs of the world, the poor creatures, the ignorant and
the barbarous, the criminals and the desperate, that he
has indirectly told the world in his “Recollections of a
Dead House,” one of the greatest masterpieces descriptively 
and psychologically, which any literature has to
show. If he had written it in his own name, and spoken
of his crime as political, the book would never have
passed the censor. Therefore an imaginary narrator is
found, who in a moment of passion has committed a
common crime, and to whose account the observations are
placed. What Dostoyevski does not tell is that he
himself was the subject of the horrible corporal punishments
which he describes.

From 1849 to 1859 Dostoyevski was wholly dead to
literature.

At the age of thirty-seven he returned home from
Siberia with his nervous system wholly destroyed. A
great change had taken place in him. In the four years
he had passed in the workhouse, he had only one single
book with him, the New Testament, and he had read it
again and again. All revolt was quenched in his soul. It
was not simply that he saw with how little knowledge of
men he had wished to reform the world, and how little
this abstract idealism availed; but for once and all he
had become meek and humble, obedient and submissive.
He found his punishment just; nay, even more, he was

grateful to the Tsar Nicholas for it. He imagined that
without it he would have become insane; thought that
the secret horror he always felt at the approach of
darkness, under normal conditions would have deprived him
of his reason; now it deprived real sufferings of their
power.

In the next place he had obtained a thorough knowledge 
of the inner life of the Russian people. His fate
had opened to him an insight into that which is generally
regarded as the sewer of humanity; and there he found
in every one, even in those who had sunken the
deepest, something of value in spite of all their depravity.
At the same time that he had lost all faith in the use or
possibility of a political revolution, he had found the
faith in a moral revolution, starting from the bottom, in
the spirit of the gospel. Thus he returned as the
philanthropist among the Russian authors, as the author
of the helpless pariahs. It has somewhere been justly
said that what Wilberforce was in the English
Parliament for the negro, he became in the Russian
literature for the proletariats, — that is, their spokesman.
As an artist he is true enough not to embellish the
pariah; as a poet he is visionary enough to proclaim the
presence of “a divine spark,” even among the wretched.
Nay more, the morality he preaches is, perhaps, the
purest expression of the morality of the pariah, of
the morality of the slave.

We are indebted to the philosopher Frederick
Nietzsche for the establishment of the real and wide
contrast between the morality of gentlemen and the
morality of slaves. The expressions originate with
him. By the morality of gentlemen is meant all that
morality which emanates from self-esteem, positive
animal spirits: the morality of Rome, of Iceland, of the
renaissance; by the morality of the slave, all that
morality which proceeds from contact with wretchedness 
as the highest virtue, from the denial of life, from
the hatred for the happy and the strong.

This continual praising of the unselfish, self-sacrificing
person, as contrasted to that person who lays all his
strength on self-preservation, self-development, and
development of power, does not by any means spring from
a spirit of unselfishness. The <i>neighbor</i> commends
unselfishness because he has the profit of it. If he thought
himself unselfish, he would reject all that which would
be to his advantage. Herein lies the fundamental
contradiction of this morality, that the motive for it is in
conflict with its principles. It is proclaimed for the
advantage of the unsuccessful men, and generally has
no more zealous or ardent advocates than that kind of
unsuccessful men who do not have enough independent
spiritual life to be able to live in the world of their
own ideas, but do have so-called culture enough to suffer
under it, and whose existence is at heart envy.
Whatever qualities and culture such men have are
strengthened by anguish; they live in a constant longing for
vengeance on those whom they think are happy.

Dostoyevski developed into a colossal example of this
type. With the worst ill-treatment of his life behind
him, and now poor, soon in debt, and in continual
endless debt, dependent on publishers, whose advances
furnish him his means of subsistence, he is to begin anew
to make his way into literature.

The first book which he wrote after his return from
Siberia, “The Injured and Oppressed,” does not belong
to his best works, but it contains characters of which his
first book had already given a hint, and which re-appear
later. He had brought back with him from Siberia a
young wife with whom he had fallen in love, the widow
of one of the adherents of Petrashevski, who had died in
prison. But she for her part was in love with another
man; and Dostoyevski’s letters show how for a whole
year he labored to unite her to his rival, and set his
friends to work to remove the obstacles out of the way
of their union. Nevertheless, it ended in the marriage of
her to Dostoyevski.

This is the reality which underlies the occurrences
in “The Injured and Oppressed,” in which the characters 
who remind one of Dickens do not, however, make
any very deep impression.

He plunged into journalism, which during his whole
life had a fascination for him, and on which he wasted
much time and force. He became a contributor to the
Slavophile newspapers published by his brother Mikhaïl,
first “The Times,” then “The Epoch,” and preached
the love and admiration for Russia “which cannot be
understood by reason, but which is a matter of faith.”

In 1865 he loses his first wife and his brother Alekseï.
Mikhaïl’s second newspaper is a failure, and he flies
from the country to escape from his creditors. He does
not enjoy the journey which he makes through
Germany, Prance, and Italy. He continually has epileptic
fits, and is obliged to return home to obtain new
advances from his publishers, which they, it is true,
concede to him, but only on the most unfavorable conditions.
He brings back only one solitary strong impression
from his travels, that of an execution to which he had
been a witness in Lyons. This recalled to him the
moment in his life in which he felt the greatest horror,
and of which the recollection is continually coming back
in his novels: that morning hour on the scaffold,
December 22, 1849.

In 1862 he made a strong impression on the reading
world by his “Recollections of a Dead House.” In
1866 he made the greatest impression of his life in
“Crime and Punishment” (<i>Prestuplenie i Nakazanie</i>).
Hardly any other work has contributed so much to the
psychology of the Russia of that time. What the book
describes is only apparently something special; in
reality, it unveils a great picture of society.

The problem of the book in a more limited sense is
one which the most thoughtful minds have struggled
with; the two apparently contradictory estimates which
society places upon the value of human life. Bismarck
has cleverly discussed this subject in his speeches.<footnote><i>Gesammelte Reden des Fürsten Bismarck</i> (by Hahn), i. 895.</footnote>
It occupied the author of this book, when several
years ago in Berlin a woman who was more than
eighty-two years old was murdered by one of the many
lovers whom she had won by her presents.<footnote>See G. Brandes: Berlin, p. 303 and following.</footnote> The
problem was this: Has human life absolute value? Why
does modern society answer this question in the most
contradictory manner? It punishes with the severest
penalty the murder by the mother of the new-born
child without regard to the fact that she for fear of
shame or of want inflicts upon herself a far greater
loss and a far greater pain than she inflicts upon
society; nay, it punishes her even if the motive of
her act was to free the child from all the misery in
store for it. Society demands that the full cup of
earthly misfortune shall be poured out upon the little
being’s head. But society does not oppose the
establishment of manufactories, the operation of which
entails sickness and often death among the workmen,
nay, even regards the founder of such a manufactory




in a quarter destitute of industrial pursuits as a
benefactor.

The one who in Dostoyevski’s work struggles with
this problem is Raskolnikof, a young Russian student,
unusually good-looking, with fine features, and
expressive black eyes, eminently gifted, but poor, as only a
Russian student is poor, plunged in the deepest poverty,
clad in rags, with a hat which cannot be seen without
awakening laughter. He has given up his studies on
account of his poverty, has tried in vain to support
himself, has let himself go to ruin. He is reserved, gruff,
suspicious, and hypochondriacal; he is proud, but also
high-minded and good; he very reluctantly betrays his
feelings. He is ambitious, with a tendency to boldness,
but often so despondent that he seems to be cold and
without sensibility to the degree of inhumanity. He is
melancholy by nature, sombre and passionate, arrogant
and magnanimous, sorrowful over the unhappy condition 
of the human race, with a constantly burning desire
to be a benefactor on a grand scale. At bottom he is
without ability. According to the opinion of the
author, that is generally the case in Russia, where
all wish to become suddenly rich without toil or
trouble, and where every one is accustomed to have
that which is generally attained brought to him all
ready, accustomed to be led about in leading-strings,
accustomed to get all the intellectual nutriment after
it has been masticated by others. Capacity does not
fall down from heaven, and for almost two centuries
the people have been weaned from every public activity.

Even if Raskolnikof was melancholy from the first,
poverty creates new melancholy in him. His wretched
room is enough to cast an uninterrupted gloom over him.
The low, small room contracts his whole soul. He 
cannot pay his rent and is frequently hungry. In the long
winter evenings he has no light and lies in the dark, and
at last does not even try to get a light; on his table his
college text-books are covered with thick dust. He
dreams, dreams continually<sp>....</sp>

He dreams of a horrible old pawnbroker-woman, very
rich and miserly, from whom he has had a loan now and
then, and of a conversation about her to which he had
once listened in a restaurant. A student sitting there
said: “I should like to kill the old crone and sack her,
and I assure you that I could do it without the least sting
of conscience.” He said it indeed as a joke, but
continued seriously: “On the one hand, a stupid, wretched,
malicious old crone, who not only never gives anything
away, but does harm to everybody she comes in contact
with; on the other hand, fresh, young powers, who fail
for want of means of support, and that by the thousands;
hundreds, perhaps thousands of existences, which might
be brought on the right path, dozens of families which
could be saved from wretchedness, from debauchery,
from loathsome disease, — all for the money of this old
crone<sp>....</sp> And, after all, what weight on the universal
scales of life has the life of this swindling, stupid,
malicious crone? Not more than a louse’s life or a
cockroach’s, and not even so much, — for the old woman does
much more harm, for she undermines the life of others.”

The words take root in Raskolnikof’s mind, just
because the same thought is ready to be developed in his
head, peeps forth from his brain like a chicken from the
shell, and especially because to his own wretchedness is
added that of others who are dearest to him. His old
mother, who is living in her country village on an annuity
of one hundred and twenty rubles a year, and who by
knitting and embroidery, which is spoiling her poor
eyes, earns twenty rubles a year more, sends him a
letter, from whose kind, considerate expressions he
learns that his only dearly loved sister, proud and
beautiful as she is, is about to offer up herself on the altar of
a detested marriage in order to be able to keep him at
the university and support her mother in her old age.
He starts up against it, he kicks against the pricks, he
will forbid his pure sister from entering into this
horrible marriage. But what right has he to forbid it?
How can he prevent it? What can he offer her instead?
To devote to her and their mother his whole future,
when he has first completed his studies and obtained a
position! In ten years perhaps! But by that time his
mother will be blind or dead from fasting or consumption, 
and by that time his sister will be<sp> ...</sp> what
cannot happen in ten years!

He had early formed a theory of his own about crime,
that the extraordinary man has the right, not the official
right, but one which his conscience gives him, to
overstep certain obstacles and barriers which circumscribe
other men; only, however, in the case that his idea, an
idea which looks towards the happiness of mankind,
demands such a step. If men like Kepler and Newton
could in no way have made their discoveries available
to the world without the taking of human life, which put
obstacles in the way of these discoveries, then they
would have had the right, nay, it would have been their
duty, to take that human life. Experience teaches him
that almost all the lawgivers and reformers of humanity,
from the oldest down to Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet,
Napoleon, have been criminals, from the very fact
that they have created a new law and set aside the old,
which was regarded by society as holy and had been
handed down from their ancestors, and that they had not
shrunk from the shedding of blood, and that even very
often entirely innocent blood, which was offered up with
heroic courage for the defence of the old law. The
masses do not recognize the right of such men, they
execute or hang them when they can compass it, but the
coming generations place these executed men on
pedestals and show them honor. And is not he himself
such an exceptional man?

But his whole being is roused against the act. It is
altogether too shameful, far too disgusting. To kill a
little old woman with an axe! All his pride, all the
nobility in his nature, shrinks and groans.

Still the days roll on — and there is no other way out;
slowly, slowly he becomes familiar with the idea; by
the strangest accident he learns a time when the old
woman on a certain evening will be alone<sp> ...</sp> it is as if
a corner of his coat had been caught on the wheel of a
machine, which winds him in with it, and with a
commingling of determined resolution and child-like
recklessness, in a moment of crime, he accomplishes the
murder — and still another murder; for her sister, a
simple and good old being, comes in just as Raskolnikof
has begun to investigate the drawers and chests of his
victim, and he strikes her down with another blow.

But he was not equal to the task, or too nobly
constituted for the misdeed, — just as you may regard it. He
can commit murder in a somnambulistic insanity, but he
does not know how to steal. He only appropriates one
or two worthless things; with the greatest difficulty he
escapes the fate of being arrested on the spot, and now
begins that period of his life when he is in no condition
to do anything else than brood over his misdeed. He
obliterates all material traces of it; but he is absorbed
in the thought of concealing it, and betrays himself 
inadvertently more every day which passes, to those who
are seeking for the perpetrator of the crime. That,
however, is not the chief thing; no discovery from
without annihilates him, but an inner one, that he is not one
of those chosen, exceptional natures to whom everything
is allowed. After having committed his crime, he is no
longer able to raise himself to the height from which he
regarded it before it was accomplished. He is consumed
by inches. “No,” he says to himself, “these men whom
we admire are not constituted as I am. The true ruler,
to whom everything is allowed, lays Toulon waste,
establishes his power in Paris by the bayonet, <i>forgets</i> an
army in Egypt, sacrifices a half a million of men on a
campaign to Moscow, then makes a pun in Vilno about
it, — and after his death he is idolized. Such men must
be of iron, not of flesh and blood.” And a collateral
idea almost makes him smile: “Napoleon, the Pyramids,
Waterloo — and a disgusting, little usury practising old
crone, with a red-strapped trunk under her bed. Would
a Napoleon ever creep in under the bed of such an old
crone?<sp> ...</sp> Insanity.”

He is not sorry for the murder of the old woman; he
continues to regard her life as a useless one, her death
as an indifferent, almost a beneficial act. The old
woman is, and continues to be, a secondary matter; he
would only by killing her bring a principle to life, kills
not a human being, but a prejudice, and strides over the
chasm which separates the every-day souls who possess
the vulgar faiths from the host of the elect. He has
killed the prejudice, but he remains just the same
standing on this side of the chasm. He is excessively
wretched, more wretched than ever before.

He has not done anything bad. He only wished not
to be obliged to pass by his starving mother and keep
her rubles in his pocket. And how conscientiously has
he not acted! He assured himself first by a careful
self-examination, that he would not overstep the barriers to
satisfy sensuous impulses, but for the sake of a great
object; so he himself selected, among all “the useless
lice,” the most useless of all, and finally determined,
although he killed the woman, to take only so much as
was absolutely necessary for the object nearest to him.

But it is not the old woman he has killed; it was
himself, his own <i>ego</i>. His deed has grown up far above his
head; it has isolated him completely, thrown him
wholly back into himself. The secret gnaws him to
insanity, and the agony of being himself “a louse,” like
all the others, paralyzes him.

Scarcely had he committed the murder before he
began to feel lonesome, strange to himself, and doomed
to everlasting dumbness. He it is who will nevermore
be able to talk with others. Soon after, he is tormented
by an insane impulse to disclose himself, to tell all
himself. He prefers immediately to throw all that he
has taken into the canal; he has no idea of using it,
conceals it under a stone in a building-lot. He does not
himself understand what has happened to him; but he
has been separated from his past, as if by the clip of
a pair of scissors. There comes a moment when he
almost jumps into the water, to make an end of all.
On his associates he makes the impression of a madman.
But he falls in with human wretchedness in its worst
form — a drunkard who dies; a consumptive widow with
a nest full of children, without bread; a noble young
girl who has been compelled to sell herself to get food
for her little brothers and sisters; and the need of
showing generosity, of helping, restores to him, for a
short time, faith in life. Still, this short rise is followed
by new pangs. The thought whether the others did not
know everything tortures him, so that he plays an
entirely useless comedy when, towards certain people, he
acts as if nothing was the matter. And really there are
some who are on the track; one who has suspected
everything and completely sees through him, and he is
a genius of a jurist, an examining magistrate. Still
Raskolnikof is neither arrested nor examined; no, what
at last opens his lips and compels him to surrender
himself is a purely inward, spiritual movement. Long
before it gains the mastery, it presents itself to him, as
the moment approaches when he must disclose himself,
and he even draws a parallel of the feelings of the
advent of this moment with his earlier perception of
the necessity that the hour was come for murdering the
old woman. Yet this feeling is continually crossed by
the feeling of growing hate towards the whole world
about him; he feels a murderous hatred towards those
in regard to whom he suspects or feels that they know
his secret. When, in his solitary ponderings, he puts to
himself the questions what, under these or those given
circumstances, he shall do in order not to be trapped, the
outburst, “Then I shall kill him,” is the constant answer
to all such questions that arise. Nay, at last, he discovers, 
with horror, that even of his mother and sisters,
who have always been so dear to him, he thinks now
and then with a feeling of hate.

And this hatred and all this anguish have their root
in love. If only he had not loved so much, all this would
not have happened.

If his soul had been barren, if he had not been bold,
magnanimous and earnest, he would never have become
a murderer. During this horrible time he feels more and
more drawn towards the young girl who has been named
before, and who has fallen on account of her love for her
little brothers and sisters. By her most strenuous
exertions she could not earn what was necessary by her
daily wages, and her own mother had driven her out
into the street. Pity had brought him into relations
with her, admiration for the nobility and purity of her
being brings him to seek her out, for not a drop of real
unchastity has as yet entered into her heart. He honors
the one despised by the world. She also has “overstepped 
the barriers,” she also has laid her hand upon a
human life, her own, has sacrificed herself and sacrificed
herself uselessly; but she stands spiritually high above
him. Little by little she becomes his conscience. One
day, when he has looked for a long time silently into her
tearful face, he throws himself down before her and
kisses her feet.

“What are you doing? What are you doing? That
to me?”

He answers: “Not to you did I bow down — I bowed
down to the total suffering of the human race.”

It is Sonya’s prayer that he shall himself confess his
guilt, “take his martyrdom upon himself;” she will
never leave him, will accompany him in his exile to
Siberia as an inmate of the House of Correction. He
hesitates a long time. His sister also urges him to
surrender himself: she sees in this step his only salvation
from the self-consumption into which he has fallen. But
when she uses the word crime, he becomes excited.
“That I have killed a disgusting, mischievous louse, an
usurious old crone, for whose death one ought to be 
forgiven forty sins, a creature that sucked the blood
out of poor folk, — that a crime!” — “Thou hast shed
blood!” breaks in the sister amazed. — “Blood!” answers
Raskolnikof. “All shed it — it flows and has always
flowed on the earth in streams, it is poured out like
champagne, and people are crowned for it on the Capitol
and then called the benefactors of mankind — I myself
only wished for the good and would have done a
hundred thousand good deeds for this one blunder, and it
wras not even a blunder, only a clumsy act. By this
blunder all I wanted was to put myself in an independent
position, make the first step, and then all this would
have been compensated by a proportionally large usefulness. 
But I have not been able to take the first step,
because I am a milksop! That is the whole of it.”

Still, in the long run, Sonya is stronger than he. He
cannot withstand the prayer of the strong woman in all
its humility and unworthiness, to make his deed known,
and the novel ends with Raskolnikof’s self-accusation at
the police-office: “It was I who murdered the old register’s 
widow and her sister with an axe and then plundered 
their property!”

In this story Dostoyevski has plainly intended to give
a picture of the times. “What is before us here,” says
the examining magistrate Porfyrius to the hero, in the
third part of the book, “is, evidently enough, a fantastic,
tragical product of the new tendency of the times; it is
a deed which only the present time could bring forth,
the time in which it is a custom to repress one’s feelings
and to give utterance to phrases like this: that blood
operates refreshing; that is a fantasy which comes from
books; it is a heart which is spasmodically overstrained
by theories; it is a determination which leads to crimes
as if strange feet carried him thither.” The author
evidently has political ferments in view, although he
takes care not to say a single word directly about
politics. There is undoubtedly contained in it an allusion
to the murder of the Tsar. “Still it is well,” Porfyrius
says to Raskolnikof, “that it was only such a wretched
old woman whom you killed; if, on the other hand, your
theory had taken another direction, then your misdeed
might have been a hundred million times more
frightful.” And indirectly, through a dream which
Raskolnikof has, while he is brooding over thoughts of murder
and is frightened at it, there is a description, which, it
is true, is not anywhere pointed directly at the Russian
people, but which undoubtedly is a symbol of the most
sombre representation of the situation. The hero sees
in his dream a miserable, emaciated, light brown
peasant-horse, harnessed to a very large, heavy wagon, which
it cannot possibly draw; but the horse is whipped again
and again by the rough owner of the wagon, without
mercy, over the muzzle, over the eyes, first with one
whip and then with three at a time; the horse groans
and puffs, can scarcely breathe, pulls, stops, tries to pull
again, cannot escape from the storm of blows, and at
last begins, to the general laughter of the men, to kick
back. The horse is whipped again — while some beat
on a drum in addition, one sings a shameless song, and a
woman contentedly cracks nuts — is whipped over the
muzzle and over the eyes. When even several heavy
blows with a wagon pole over the back are not able to
drive the horse forward, the owner seizes a great iron
bar and gives the horse a blow with that. The horse
tries for the last time to pull, then falls down on the
ground and breathes his last. When the social condition
is of the kind described here symbolically, it is no
wonder that sanguinary thoughts spring up in the minds
of the youth.

Even if it is not a political crime which Dostoyevski
has represented, it is a crime which has this in common
with the political, that it is not mean, was not committed
for the vulgar, low object of procuring for the perpetrator 
greater personal profit, but was in a certain degree
unselfish, and, what is most important above all, it was
committed by a person who at the moment of the crime
does not harbor a doubt as to his right. In the mean
time, if we compare the men and women whom in recent
years we have seen sentenced in Russia for intent to
commit murder, and not less those who have been
executed as accessories to the assassination of the Tsar
with this homicide, then the contrast is striking. Those
persons were not in any way ruined by the spiritual
consequences of their deed; they had as conspirators in
and after the moment of the murder been in full accord
with their inmost being; their conviction continued to
be unshaken and unmoved to the last. If they had
escaped detection, in all probability they would have
lived to the end of their lives without any other than
peaceful and proud thoughts about their attempts at the
murder of a being whose extermination they regarded
as a good deed, nay, as a duty. Raskolnikof, on the
other hand, is destroyed by the consequences of the
murder.

Like the political criminals, he started from a certain
fixed principle, which, it is true, is not mentioned in the
book, but which, nevertheless, lies at the foundation of
his way of proceeding, that the end justifies the means.

This principle, which simplicity has misunderstood
and Jesuitism has misused, is exactly and literally sound.
The word “justifies” indicates that a good, valuable end
is meant. He has a good, valuable end who would
maintain or produce results of real value.

Suppose that one could obtain his good end only by
inflicting suffering, and suppose that this suffering is
less than that which will be produced if he avoids
making use of the means. Suppose, for example, that
a man wishes the good of his fellow-citizens, and can
arrive at his end only by removing a single man (it may
be one who is infected with a contagious disease, or a
tyrant), then his act is deserving of honor, if of two
evils — one or the other of which must necessarily be
incurred — he chooses the lesser. The objection which
lies near to this, that he cannot foresee the results of
his act, signifies nothing, because the morality depends
upon the intent and not upon the result. In our daily
life no one entertains any doubt as to the soundness of
the principle; we are quite familiar with the idea that
there are no absolute duties. Society teaches: Thou
must not kill, but adds: Except where your fatherland
(the good end) demands it, for then it becomes not only
allowable, but a duty, to kill the largest possible number
of enemies. Society teaches: It is a bad act to cut off
the arms or legs of another, but adds: when the
physician amputates an arm or a leg to save the life of the
sick or wounded, then the good end justifies the means.

In order that the principle shall be applicable, the
following conditions must be fulfilled: The end must be
good. The end must be such that it cannot be attained
by any other means than those which inflict the pain,
nor even by means which inflict less pain than those
which are employed. — The suffering which is used as a
means must be less than that which would exist without
the use of the means. — With regard to all these points,
the typical Russian terrorist, before as well as after his
onslaught upon the course of events, would be without
any concern whatever. Why, then, was Raskolnikof not
so also?

Although Dostoyevski undoubtedly was not in the
least degree partial to political terrorists, since even
political progressionists were hateful to him, he has
manifested on this point an extraordinary discrimination. 
He does not particularly deny the justice of
Raskolnikof’s reasoning, but shows that he is confused as to
his end, uncertain if it is really good or not. In
desperation he says to Sonya, a month after the deed, that he
has continually been uncertain. When he examines
himself he finds that in fact he has not committed murder to
support his mother nor to become a benefactor of
mankind, but in order to find out if he like the others was a
“louse,” not a man, that is, if he was in a position to
overstep the barriers or not. He is uncertain about his
end and uncertain about his inward authority to pursue
this indefinite end, which, according to his own theory,
only the elect are at liberty to use all means to attain.
When he for a whole day has tortured himself with
the question whether Napoleon would have done such
an act, he already felt dimly that he was not a
Napoleon.

Therefore he was wholly overwhelmed by the consequences 
of the deed. He wished only to kill an old
monster; but that was hardly done before necessity
compelled him, to escape detection, to kill a poor, kindly
being who had never done harm to any mortal, nay, had
continually been a sacrifice for others. Since then he
has even been obliged to recognize Lisavieta’s spiritual
kinship to Sonya, whom he respects so greatly. He
says somewhere, “Oh, how I hate this wretched old
woman! I believe I could strike her down once more
if she awakened to life. But the poor Lisavieta! Why
must she come in! Strange that I almost not at all
think of her, just as if I had not killed her! Lisavieta!
Sonya!<sp> ...</sp> Ye poor things, ye mild women with timid
eyes,<sp> ...</sp> ye dear women,<sp> ...</sp> why do ye not weep?
why do ye not groan?<sp> ...</sp> They sacrifice everything
with their mild and quiet looks.”

Yet far more than the murder of Lisavieta, which had
not been wished for, the fear of being arrested tortured
him, and the system of dissimulation and denial and
lying, in which he involves himself. His reason is not
solid enough to endure it, and, until he confesses, he is
continually on the verge of insanity. In an epilogue
which takes place in Siberia, Dostoyevski then suffers
Raskolnikof’s defiant and yet troubled nature to be at
once dissolved in tenderness and strengthened in spirit
by the faithful, enduring love of Sonya. Raskolnikof
is an “infidel,” but Sonya a believer. Even before
Raskolnikof has recognized his guilt, there is an
affecting scene where Sonya reads aloud to him from the New
Testament, — a scene where a tallow candle in the
battered candlestick in the poor room at once shines upon
a murderer, a fallen woman, and the gospel between
them, — a truly Christian scene, stamped with genius.
In the epilogue, for which Dostoyevski has plainly wished
to make use of his experiences in Siberia, his religious
convictions, direct and doctrinal, make their appearance.
As I have heard a young Russian lady express it, we
very often in reading Dostoyevski have a feeling that the
characters which he has created are more profound than
the author himself. He was not capable of
understanding the scope of his own work.

If we should now study the subordinate characters
only approximately with the same care with which the
character of the chief person has been examined, we
shall find that they, almost without exception, ten in
number as they are, stand on a level with the hero by
the force and truth with which they are drawn, and that
all stand in some relation to him. There is no 
superfluous person in the book. Among the most admirably
conceived characters are the examining magistrate
Porfyrius, a legal genius, and the landed proprietor
Svidrigaïlof, a very complex nature, a voluptuary, who is in
love with Raskolnikof’s sister, and who pursues her. He
is a man of intellect, has an excellent head, and, although
he has one or more unrepented murders on his conscience,
he possesses both courage and sense of honor in his way.
As the murderer from selfishness, by numerous details
in regard to his way of acting and thinking, he forms a
contrast to the hero of the book, who writhes under
Svidrigaïlof’s contention that they have one certain
characteristic in common.

Dostoyevski’s delineation of character here is of the
first rank; it is profound, and bold. Nevertheless,
after the manner of Dickens, it leaves almost the whole
of the relations between the sexes, if not untouched,
yet undescribed. In this domain, however, the poet
does not escape the paradoxical; thus the morally
irreproachable fallen woman reminds us more of an
antithesis in human form by Victor Hugo than of a real
person.

His aversion to describing the natural sensual life is
all the more impressive since here, as in most of the
author’s other books, he dwells on unnatural, turbid
appetites. We notice Svidrigaïlof’s hideous passion for
young girls. And we compare the amazing inquisition
in “The Possessed,” where Shatof questions Stavrogin
if it is true that in St. Petersburg he belonged to a
secret society which had for its object the satisfaction of
unnatural lust, if he has really said that the Marquis
de Sade could go to school to him, and if he has
debauched and misused children.<footnote><i>Nihilister</i> (Danish translation), i. 319.</footnote>



It is evident that Dostoyevski’s fancy frequently
turned on such unnatural inclinations, just because,
according to his train of reasoning, there is no room
left for a sound sensuousness. His inclination to
describe bodily sufferings, the dwelling greatly on
cruelties, are suggestive of unnatural desires. It is peculiar
that Turgenief again and again returns to the comparison 
between Dostoyevski and De Sade. Quite evidently
it is very much in consequence of his dislike to see his
hateful rival installed as a hero, but also it is plain that
it was Turgenief’s conviction that there is to be found
here physiologically and psychologically a real kinship.<footnote>See especially Turgenief’s letter to Saltykof of September 24, 1882.</footnote>

Thus much is clear at all events, that with Dostoyevski’s 
gifts there was a perverse nervousness.

However high the delineation of character stands in
“Crime and Punishment,” the book suffers from the
imperfections of the narrative style. The portions in
dialogue are immeasurably the best. As soon as the
author himself begins to talk, art ceases. Dostoyevski
was not able, like Turgenief, to acquire the French art
of narration; what he appropriated to himself from
them was their ideal of humanity, a national, fundamental 
view, which is akin to that of Louis Blanc and
of Victor Hugo in his later years.

Though an author of such a high rank, he was an
artist of a low rank. He allowed all his writings to be
printed as they ran off from his pen, without revision of
any kind whatever, to say nothing of recasting them.
He did not trouble himself to give them the highest
possible degree of perfection by condensation or
pruning, but only worked as a journalist works, and is
therefore universally too prolix.

Thus so far as this, his best work, is concerned, it is

clear that he in the first part had not known anything
at all about the treatise which in the second part he
states that Raskolnikof had written about his theory.
Certain expressions in the first part are even at variance
with what the hero must have written in such a treatise.
Moreover, it is very little in harmony with the modern
art of narration when in numerous places in the novel
the author uses such turns as: “<i>Later</i> we learn that
Svidrigaïlof that evening also had made a visit,” or
“When he <i>afterwards</i>, long afterwards, remembered this
time, it was clear to him that his consciousness must
have been confused,” or “<i>Afterwards</i> it was wonderful
to Sonya that she thus at once had seen,” etc. By such
turns the author strives to fill up the gaps and
omissions in the descriptions. Somewhere Dostoyevski even
writes with the genuine olden-time naïveté: “We will
temporarily leave the whole line of thought by which
Raskolnikof reaches this result; besides we have already
<i>anticipated</i> it too much. <i>Yet we add only</i>, that the
actual material difficulties of the undertaking played
only a weak part in his mind.” Anticipations and
excuses for anticipations have just as little place in a
novel as gaps and gap-stoppers.

It is already seen from “Crime and Punishment” in
what sense Dostoyevski can be said to be the author of
the proletariats. As no one else he has known and
understood the proletariat both of intelligence and of
ignorance.

His chief characteristic, when he presents it, is a kind
of psychological clairvoyance, which deserts him when
he describes the upper classes. (See, e. g., the Prince
in “The Injured and Oppressed.”) The force and
extent of this clairvoyance is especially traced where
the healthy spiritual condition borders upon the domain
of insanity. Towards the human spiritual condition he
has the sure insight of a physician for the insane, but
it acts with him, as sometimes with such physicians,
that the habit of constantly having spiritual abnormities 
before him leads him to see the abnormal everywhere, 
and by degrees disturbs the equilibrium of his
own mind.

He likes to take his stand on the dividing line which
separates rational trains of thought from the exalted, and
proper modes of action from the criminal. From the
narrow and low embankment he looks on both sides and
never forgets to call the reader’s attention to how
narrow and low the difference in reality is between health
and disease, right and wrong. With a peculiar mastership 
he depicts the intellectual dizziness which makes
men rush headlong into a gulf of crime or sacrifice. He
knows, as no other person knows, the irresistible
attraction of gulfs.

As a judge of spiritual life he is wholly pathological.
The perpetual sensitiveness, which is the result of his
epileptic nature, is also his strength. His own bad
health, his nervous tremors, his hallucinations, his fits,
pass through into the persons whom he describes. The
horror which oppressed him when he first received the
sentence of death, and afterwards when he faced the
punishment of the lash, meets one in the attitude of his
principal characters in the face of punishment
(Raskolnikof, a number of persons in “The Dead House,”
Dmitri in “The Brothers Karamazof”), most distinctly
perhaps in “he Idiot” (Prince Myshkin), where the
hero, in the very beginning of the book, exhibits to his
valet all the horrors of the man condemned to death.
It is developed here that the putting to death in
pursuance of a sentence of a court is disproportionately more
odious than the most dreadful murder, and it is added, in
conclusion: “Perhaps there is a man to whom a sentence
of death has been read only to torment him.” There is
always this background of agony and terror.

The greater number of Dostoyevski’s characters are
visionary. Thus there are in “The Brothers Karamazof” 
alone, the youngest of the brothers, Aliosha,
who reads in the souls of others and sees what is hidden,
and the noble monk Zossima, the saint of the book, who
foresees the temptation of Dmitri to parricide, and in
the Christian mysticism casts himself on his knees
before him, as before the most sinful, and therefore the
nearest to salvation.<footnote>Dostoyevski: <i>Les Frères Karamazof</i>, by Halpérine-Kaminsky,
ii. p. 223 and i. p. 38.</footnote> The hero in “The Idiot,” Prince
Myshkin, is epileptic, and so is the murderer Smerdiakof,
in “The Brothers Karamazof.”

Since Dostoyevski’s strength is in pathology, it is quite
natural that his three principal books should describe
criminal natures. We find them in “The Brothers
Karamazof,” as well as in “The Dead House;” but
“Crime and Punishment,” nevertheless, contains the
typical example of his masterpiece of psychological
analysis; it unfolds the crime in its whole growth, from the
first cell until it bears its last fruit. As a judge of the
diseased condition of the mind, as an author of the
“moral fever,” Dostoyevski has not his equal.

It is natural that in an author who is so exclusively
psychological, the natural environments play almost no
part. What he needs of a landscape is the strip of the
horizon, the glimpse of the blue sky, which is visible
from a garret in the suburbs of a great city, or through
the panes placed high up in a prison cell. With him it
is all repartee, conversation; to that extent everything
is dramatic.

Dostoyevski is the greatest dialectician among the
Russian authors. His great strength is his amazing skill
of question and answer in dialogue. The soliloquy —
and he is never tired of employing it — analyzes a
matter from its different aspects in the most delicate details.
Dialogue, with him, is a kind of inquisition, a continued
contest between men, who seek to wrest their secrets
from each other. De Voguë’s expression is very apt,
when he says that he combines the disposition of a
compassionate sister with the abilities of a chief inquisitor.
The same author has also very truly said of him that his
characters are never shown to us in a tranquil state,
obeying the rule of reason. One of them never sits
quietly at a table, occupied with one thing or another.
It is said: “He was lying upon the sofa, with closed
eyes, but not sleeping<sp>....</sp> He went out on the street
without knowing where he was<sp>....</sp> He stood
immovable, with his look persistently fixed on a point out
into vacancy.” They never eat, but they drink tea at
night. They almost never sleep, and when they do they
dream.<footnote>De Voguë: <i>Le Roman Russe</i>, p. 257.</footnote>

Nothing is more foreign to them and their author
than the code of honor of Western Europe, as it is most
clearly stated in the dramas of Calderon, and still exists
as a legacy from the age of chivalry in the Latin and
German society. In the world which Dostoyevski opens
up to us, the most insulting charges, nay, a blow in the
face, are no disgrace to a man. They speak about a
flogging as the most natural thing in the world. In a
Christian spirit, and in perfect accord with the national
mysticism, suffering is regarded almost as a blessing.
One of Dostoyevski’s characters says, “I am afraid that
I am not worthy of my torture.” The torture is 
considered as a kind of distinction. It always ransoms
somebody or something. When the torture is endured,
the guilt which caused it is expiated.

Still more: suffering in this world turned upside
down is a temptation. Shatof says to Stavrogin 
(<i>Nihilister</i>, i. 320): “Do you know why you made this
low and shameful marriage?<sp> ...</sp> You married from
a desire to feel pain, pangs of conscience, from moral
luxury. It was a nervous irritation.” And this
conception is not exceptional.

Therefore it is that the extremely significative desire
to live which is purely characteristic of the Byzantine
Christianity becomes the principle of evil with
Dostoyevski. This is what he has mystically embodied in
the three brothers Karamazof. The atheistical Iván
says to his younger brother, “Do you know that if I had
lost my faith in life,<sp> ...</sp> still I would not have killed
myself, I would live in spite of everything! I have
lifted the enchanted cup to my lips, I shall not let it
go till I have drained it to the dregs<sp>....</sp> More than
once I have asked myself if there is a pain in the world
which is able to conquer this unquenchable thirst, this
thirst for life, which, perhaps, is unseemly; but I do not
think that before my thirtieth year any such pain has
been given to me. I know very well that this thirst for
life is what the moralists, especially those who write
verse, the consumptive people, who always have a cold
in the head, call low and contemptible. It is also true
that this thirst for life is a trait which is characteristic
in the Karamazof family: to live! cost what it will!
It is also in you. But what is there low in it!”<footnote><i>Les Frères Karamazof</i>, i. 205.</footnote>

Although the thirst for life is an evil, yet suffering,
without something more, is not a good. Dostoyevski,

with all his (unconsciously cruel) dwelling on torture,
and the enjoyment of torture, is too gentle and
nervously weak and shattered not to melt in pity thereat.
Nay, pity is a kind of religion with him, and it
sometimes conflicts with his system, his faith in God, his
Christianity. He is dialectician enough to evolve a
fearful attack upon faith in God from suffering upon
earth. We read, for instance, Iván’s enumeration of
all the cruelties of men towards defenceless animals,
little children; his busying himself with all the
refinements of cruelties: a little horse, whipped over the
eyes; a girl seven years old, who is whipped with
thorns; a girl of five, who, on a cold night in winter, is
locked up in a closet, and whose face is smeared with
filth, which she is made to eat; a serf boy eight years
old, whom a general suffers to be torn to pieces by his
dogs, — all this without the intervention of God, — and
we ponder over his conclusion: It is possible that all
this fits into the heavenly harmony of the Almighty;
but I do not recognize it; it counterbalances for me not
a single tear of a child.

The young hero Aliosha, on Dostoyevski’s behalf,
disposes of this doubt with the answer, “There is a
Being who can forgive all, for he himself has poured out
his innocent blood for all men and things.”

The argument is not much better than that which, in
another place in the book (ii. 209), the devil in a
hallucination uses with Iván: “What pleasure can one have
without suffering? It would all be like an unending
ceremonial, — holy, but unendingly tedious.”

With a very extraordinaiy sublimity and greatness,
Dostoyevski has developed the religious problem, as it
appeared to him, in the ingenious poem, “The Chief
Inquisitor,” which he puts into the mouth of Iván, and
for whose sake alone “The Brothers Karamazof” ought
to be translated.

Christ has come back upon the earth. He shows
himself at a great <i>auto-da-fé</i> in Seville, where hundreds of
heretics are burned in his honor, gently walking about
in the ashes of the fire. All know him, the common
people throng around him, he blesses them. Then the
chief inquisitor, an old man of ninety, causes him to be
arrested, imprisoned, and placed in a cell used for those
who are condemned to the stake, and there visits him in
the night. A conversation then follows between the
inquisitor and Christ, or rather a long monologue of the
former, which is not interrupted by any answer, — a
monologue in which the cardinal shows the Saviour how
wrong he has been in coming again and disturbing the
work of his believers, and proclaims to him his fixed
intention of letting him be burned alive as a heretic
in order to bring peace to his work. The inquisitor
unfolds to Christ the faults, the political faults, he
committed in his lifetime. The most important of all
was that he did not accept the offer of the tempter to
change stones to bread, but showed himself to men with
empty hands. He thereby made it possible for them
who rise up against him to rally about the watchword:
“Give them first meat, if thou wilt that they shall be
good.” “We,” says the cardinal, “give them bread. We
understand how to lie, and we speak in thy name. And
they end by bringing us their freedom, laying it down
at our feet, and asking us for chains and bread. There
are only three forces on earth which can keep that
humanity in check, which is really so weak and yet
so rebellious, and these are: the miracle, the mystery,
and the authority. And thou hast rejected these forces
to proclaim a freedom which it was particularly 
necessary to confiscate, and a love with which mankind
cannot be governed; therefore it has been necessary to
correct thy work, to correct it by the power of Rome
and with the sword of Caesar, and make some hundreds
of thousands of progressive spirits unhappy, exterminate 
them when it was possible, in order to secure the
weal of untold millions. To-morrow I shall have you
burned. <i>Dixi</i>."

Christ does not answer a word, but looks into the eyes
of the inquisitor with a mild but firm gaze, then he
quietly moves his face close to the inquisitor’s, and kisses
the old man on his bloodless mouth.

Then the old man trembles, opens the cell door, and
says, “Go your way, and come again never more<sp> ...</sp>
never, never more!”

This poem is condemned in the novel as the offspring
of an atheistical train of thought, but even the composition 
shows with what seriousness and versatility Dostoyevski 
has asked the question and tested the different
answers.

The period from 1871 to 1881 was the most peaceful
in Dostoyevski’s life. His second marriage was
instrumental in introducing order in his household affairs.
He eclipsed in popularity all the writers who were at
first regarded as his equals, especially causing Písemski’s
reputation to grow pale in comparison. But he also
eclipsed Turgenief, who had so long been regarded as
his superior. All the ill will which this great author
had stirred up among the Slavophiles and radicals enured
for a long time to the advantage of Dostoyevski. When,
in 1880, the unveiling of Pushkin’s statue in Moscow
was the occasion of a great national literary festivity,
at which the greatest authors made speeches, Turgenief’s
was applauded, but Dostoyevski’s excited raptures and
sobs; and when he had finished, he was carried about in
triumph.<footnote>The most of Dostoyevski’s novels have been translated into
Danish, as well as Písemski’s excellent novel, “Thousand Souls.”
“Crime and Punishment” has been translated into English, and
published by T. Y. Crowell & Co., New York.</footnote>

In his monthly periodical, “The Diary of an Author,”
he now preached faith in Russia as a duty and attacked
with equal bitterness the Russian “intelligence” and
the culture of Western Europe, which had become to
him the culture of Babel and of Sodom. He was thus
regarded as the greatest popular author of Russia at the
time of his death. The sorrow at his loss was a national
sorrow; forty thousand men followed him to his grave.
The Russian students sent an open letter to his widow,
in which appears, among other things: —

“Dostoyevski’s ideals will never be forgotten; from
generation to generation we shall hand them down as
a precious inheritance from our great, beloved teacher.
<sp>...</sp> His memory will never be extinguished in the
hearts of the Russian youth, and, as we love him, we
will also teach our children to honor and love the man
for whom we now so bitterly and disconsolately mourn.
<sp>...</sp> Dostoyevski will always stand bright before us in
our battle of life; we shall always remember that it was
he who taught us the possibility of preserving the purity
of the soul undefiled in every position of life and in all
circumstances.”

It was, as we see, the Slavophile direction of thought
which spoke the last word at his death.

<sc>Russia</sc>’s last great realist and dreamer, Count Leo
Nikolayevitch Tolstoï, is more powerful than
Turgenief and more healthy than Dostoyevski. He
approaches Turgenief in pessimism; in Slavic piety and
faith in the Russian common people he approaches
Dostoyevski. In common with the latter, he has a
distrust of the culture of Western Europe, only he extends
it so as to embrace all civilization.

His fancy is far-reaching, epic. So far as he is
concerned, the proposition is true that the novel is the
modern epic. He has not only like other authors given
a phase of culture and the life of so-called good society
in and out of the capitals of Russia, but in his greatest
work he has depicted an age, an army, a people, and a
historic catastrophe of the first rank, Napoleon’s
campaign and defeat on Russian soil.

He was born August 28, 1828, on the estate Yásnaya
Polyána, in the department of Tula, lost his father in
1837, went to the University of Kazán in 1843, where
he studied jurisprudence and the Oriental languages, but
returned to his estate at the end of three years. In
1851 he served in the army of the Caucasus, where he
made his first essay as an author, took part in the
Crimean War, was in the battle at Tchernaya and the
siege of Sevastopol, and, on the conclusion of peace,
obtained his discharge. In 1857 he made his first
journey abroad, visiting Germany and Italy. On his
estate, where he came in close contact with the common
people and studied their natures, he established a free
school and busied himself in all directions with
meditating on what could and ought to be done for the common
people. He married in 1862. He first contemplated
writing a great novel about the “Decembrists” (the
heroes of the revolts of 1825), but abandoned this idea
for another, of which “War and Peace” was the result
(1865-1868). “Anna Karénina” followed in 1878, and
later, novels, plays, sketches of the people, confessions.

It is indicative of the kind of Tolstoï’s faith in reality
that he began as an observer of himself, and an
autobiographer. Turgenief keeps himself wholly in the
background in his writings. When we catch a glimpse of
the author himself in Dostoyevski’s works it is in those
characters which wholly sacrifice themselves for others,
and generally in turn are despised, because they lack
all the fascinating qualities with which the more
ordinary persons are adorned. Thus it is with the narrator
of the story, Iván Petróvitch, in “The Injured and
Oppressed.” There is a gleam of the same thing even
in old Makar Alekseyevitch, in “Poor Folk.” His
description of himself in “The Dead House” is
pathetically modest, even humble, although the author lets it be
understood that the narrator is regarded by the others
as an uncommon person. But when he uses himself as
a model, Dostoyevski always draws a person of the most
extraordinary goodness. In his novel, “The Idiot,” he
has presented himself in the guise of the hero, Prince
Myshkin. Myshkin is a genius of the greatest ability,
a child in simplicity and purity of heart. For four and
twenty years he has been afflicted with that incurable
disease, epilepsy, so that he acquiesces with mildness
when, even although he is in possession of all his 
faculties, he is treated as one who is sick or insane, one who
is on tjie point of “having a convulsive fit.” He has no
fine manners, is not able to husband his ideas, and
therefore, as he himself says, uses words which are not
suitable for the lofty thoughts he would express, and, as
it were, disgrace them. But, notwithstanding this,
there is no one in his circle of acquaintances, not one,
who is worthy of such words. Dostoyevski proclaims
that through the mouth of a young girl: “There is no
one here who is worthy of your soul, your heart, nay,
not even of your little finger. You are more honest
than all of us, nobler and wiser than any one of us.”

If Tolstoï begins by describing himself, it is because
he wants to describe what he knows. He, relates the
life of his childhood and youth (“Childhood,” “Youth”);
then, indirectly, but in a transparent manner, his
experiences as an officer in the Caucasus (“The Cossacks”),
his memories of war (“Pictures of War,” “Sevastópol”).
In every place where he gives a picture of himself the
criticisms of himself and the use of irony towards
himself are palpable. He unveils his own weaknesses,
shows us his own follies. He never makes the
impression of an ideal figure. On the contrary, it is he
who less often than others succeeds in winning hearts,
and who does not deserve any other happiness than that
which falls to his lot. In “The Cossacks,” his Olyenin,
like Petschórin with Lermontof, is a Russian officer
of the elegant world, living in the Caucasus. But while
Petschórin, in spite of all his coldness, everywhere
meets with a warm reception from the women, Olyenin,
from his passionate love cherished for a long time for a
child of nature, a Cossack girl, reaps only such ill will
and contempt that she would not even turn her head
towards him when he went away. In Lermontof’s book
the highly cultured man is attractive even when he
is tired of the world; for Tolstoï the object here, as
ever, is to extol the superiority of nature to the results
of artistic culture. And to this love and admiration for
nature we may attribute the fact that the Caucasian
landscape, which in “The Hero of Our Time” was only
a frame, in “The Cossacks” presents itself identified
with the freshness and force of the nature of man: “the
everlasting snow, untouched by man, and the exalted
woman in her primitive beauty.”<sp> ... </sp> “I rejoiced over
her as over the glory of the mountains and of the
heavens, and could not help rejoicing, for she is as
beautiful as they.”<sp> ... </sp> “Perhaps I love in her the nature,
the embodiment of everything that is beautiful in
nature,” etc. We feel that something besides
self-glorification is dear to the author, namely fidelity to
reality.

It is this fidelity to reality which moves us
everywhere in Tolstoï: — First, where the author’s own
character is traced in his created characters, as in certain heavy
natures, strong and awkward men, who, without any
special stimulus, for a long time allow themselves to float
with the stream, until an awakening of their religious
natures calls all their best qualities into action: Bezukhoï
in “War and Peace,” Levin in “Anna Karénina,” are
examples. In the next place, where Tolstoï describes
the every-day life of strange natures, as in the finished,
bitterly veracious story “Family Happiness,” which is
strongly effective, simply and only in the development
of the way in which the illusions of life spring up, are
nourished and lost. It describes the growth and
blossoming of love, then the slow transformation which
degrades the love of the two consorts to friendship, and
at last allows tenderness for the children to displace
every other sentiment. It is every-day life, without even
a single romantic event.

Next to fidelity to reality the quality of divination,
the gift of being able to anticipate, is noteworthy in
Tolstoï. He possesses the extremely rare historical
imagination.

It is quite true that he has a spirit sufficiently modern
not to make any attempts to conjure up distant persons,
who have long since died. He does not go farther back
than to an epoch where he is assisted by a tradition still
vigorous. Nevertheless, his description of a past historic
period, like that of Alexander the First, is admirable.
His historical portraits make an impression as if the
picture was painted on a foundation of personal
experiences. His Napoleon, his Kutúzof, are instances.

There are perhaps in all only two artistic descriptions
in which the appearance of Napoleon makes the
impression of entire truthfulness, and which are drawn with
genuine art. One is Alfred de Vigny’s admirable
description of Napoleon’s conversation with the Pope, in
<i>Servitude et Grandeur Militaires;</i> the second is the scene
in “War and Peace,” where Napoleon gives an audience
to the Russian envoy Balashóf. It is written as if the
author was present unseen.

How expressive is such a little trait as this of
Napoleon: “His white and fat neck was set off sharply
against the black collar of his uniform, from which
there came a strong smell of eau-de-cologne.” We feel
the parvenu in this paltry detail.

Tolstoï’s Kutúzof is a characteristic picture of the
same rank. Nevertheless, however eminent it is as a
work of art, it certainly has great defects as a portrait.
It can hardly be doubted that, for national and religious
reasons, the author has placed too high an estimate on
Kutúzof, and too low an estimate on Napoleon. What
is emphasized in Napoleon is the violence and the
foolish arrogance which unconsciously stand before a fall;
what we lack the impression of is of the force of his
genius. In Kutúzof, even inaction, nay, imbecility, is
extolled as the expression of a profound knowledge to
what extent matters go as they will or rather as they
must, without the interference of any single man having
any special effect one way or the other.

This partiality, however, depends entirely on Tolstoï’s
peculiar views of life. Without the nervousness or
exaltation of Dostoyevski, he is just as far as the latter
from having a reverence for human intelligence and for
political or scientific greatness.

In Germany authors believe in reason and culture, in
England on the independent power of the individual,
in France on abilities, in the North on morality; Tolstoï,
as Russians so frequently are, is impressed with the
insignificance of the single man in the presence of the
universe. He cherishes a reverence for the universe
and for fate, but has none for science, art, or culture.

In his view nothing depends on science or art. No,
life and death are two great, earnest, inscrutable things.
The great sermon which life and death daily preach into
the ear of the author stifles the noise of the whole earth
for him. The understanding of man seems to him so
weak in the face of the enigma of life that the simplest
intelligence here is no better than the highest.

And the will of man is to be counted as nothing in
regard to the irresistible stream of historic events. It is
not the leader of the army who in reality leads the army;
fate drives it on; the battle is won or lost without his
intervention, by the play of the secret impelling power.

A scene typical of Tolstoï is that where the wounded
Prince Andreï, lying stretched out on the battle-field,
looks up to the heavens. Napoleon, with his suite, stops
by the side of the wounded man. The now feeble man,
whose admiration for Napoleon had hitherto been so
boundless, finds him small and unimportant in comparison 
with what is going on between his own soul and the
immeasurable heavens.

It is significant that hardly any other author has
described so frequently and with such confidence and
versatility as Tolstoï, how people die. He is equally
conversant with the feelings which precede suicide, — man’s
as well as woman’s — with the emotions with which the
wise and the foolish in sickness await the coming of
death, and with the terror and the final release which
death brings in battle.

From Tolstoï’s lack of scientific culture and his weak
faith in the intelligence of man results the ideal he has
created for himself of a return to nature. It does not
correspond to Rousseau’s, for it has a religious
character; but it reminds one of it. The peasant Karatáyef,
in “War and Peace,” makes so deep an impression on
Bezukhoï, not only because he is a primitive creation
but because he has the resignation and the Christian
brotherly love which the civilized man lacks.

Tolstoï is a pure romanticist to the extent that he
does not seek his ideal before us, but behind us, in the
lowest classes. He is not a pure pessimist, in so far as,
however black the situation appears to him, he
continually tries to embody his ideal, and preaches its
realization to others. In this the pessimism which
appears in his writings differs sharply from that in
which in our day the French literature has culminated,
the most characteristic expression of which is found in
the writings of Huysmann, a conscientious artist and a
man without hope. The pessimism of the latter consists
in his being tired of life and disgusted with it. All
that he has seen and experienced was to an intolerable
degree vulgar and low. He suffers and is wounded by
everything which there presents itself to his view, and
it is very significant that he has created a character in a
novel, who retires to a solitary life, to whom the reality
is so hateful that he replaces the natural by the
artificial, even natural by artificial light, and who from the
simple classics, which are not spicy enough and which he
despises, resorts to the very unnatural writers.

With this radical pessimism the pessimism of Tolstoï
has one point of contact: the dislike of what is plain
and rational. But for the typical French pessimist life
is a worthless thing, whose enigma is not worth
pondering over. The only thing which the pessimists of this
literature honor and love is art. And the same thing
which they loathe in real life, they honor when they find
it in art. For only where the work of art almost
exclusively represents that which in itself is purely
commonplace and ungraceful are they sure that what they love in
the work is the art itself. The lover of art indeed often
prefers the low and the sordid as the subject in order to
be able to the full extent to enjoy the art in the manner
of its treatment.

For Tolstoï, on the other hand, life is so serious and
inexhaustible a thing that his interest for art was from
the first infinitesimal, in comparison with the interest
which he bestows upon the questions of life and
happiness. Upon the whole, art has never had an
independent value for him, and in his last period he looks down
upon his earlier works as far too artistic. He is wholly
absorbed in a kind of Christian socialism of a wholly personal 
and eccentric nature, and it is evident that, so far
as he gives art any importance, it is only as the organ of
the sound views of life, as the power which elevates the
people on the largest scale.

It is impossible to enter into the spirit of a view of
art which despises the form, the style, even the element
which makes the art an art.

There can, however, be no doubt as to which of the
two constructions is best adapted to advance a literature
which is not on its decadence, but in full prosperity;
that which regards literature as an organ for ideas, or
that which cultivates the form of art simply as form.

The teaching that art is its own end is sound enough,
but must not be understood as sanctioning speaking or
writing only for the sake of speaking and writing. Only
where there are broad views and great thoughts is there
to be found in literature that principle of life which
saves it from being lost in its barrenness.

Therefore the intellectual life of Russia is in no
danger from Tolstoï’s more recent disdain of art.

Why speak of what all know who have in any way
kept up with the times: of the great man’s remorse for
the thoughtless life of his youth, which — as his books
of that epoch show — now appears to him far more
thoughtless than it really was, — of his public confession,
dignified and naïve, the confession of a contemplative
man who was not created for a thinker, — of his self-made
religious system, which adopts the instruction of
Christianity about the unlawfulness of war, nay, of all armed
defence, and in which the principle, that after the blow
on one cheek we ought to turn the other also, becomes
its chief corner-stone. That there are very great
objections to this is more than evident: but what interests
us Is not that, but the genuine Russian character of this
fundamental idea and of this predominant emotion. It
is as if even this peace-loving, utterly unwarlike spirit
of the people, which is peculiarly Russian, had become
instrumental in the development of Tolstoï’s religious
teaching.

The philologian Carl Abel somewhere says, after
having given the linguistic characteristics of the Great and
Little Russian people: “There is still a nationality in
Russia more important than either of the two already
mentioned. This most remarkable kind of men consists
of the higher classes of the empire. As a fusion of all
the different races which are collected under the sceptre
of the Tsar, these higher classes constitute one of the
most gifted, courageous, and enterprising types of
mankind produced anywhere on the face of the earth. In
them sound Finnish reason is combined with Polish
boldness, Armenian sagacity with the German reflective
and methodical manner of thought, and to the patient
endurance of the Tatar is added the suppleness of the
Slav.” And he declares that if Russia has accomplished
much in diplomacy and war, it is due to this group of
leaders.<footnote>Carl Abel: Slavic and Latin, p. 51.</footnote>

That interests Tolstoï least because war and
diplomacy are just the things which do not interest him at
all. And it is to those who have hitherto been under
the necessity of blind obedience to this group of leaders
that his whole sympathy is secured. It is with them
that he in his employments, nay, in dress and externals, 
has gradually sought to identify himself, partly in
order to become thoroughly acquainted with their
manner of feeling, and partly not to look down upon them
in any respect.

One of my acquaintances, a very dispassionate jurist,
who visited him at his estate last summer, could not
speak of his visit without emotion. Concerning the
reports of a decay in Tolstoï’s intellectual power he said:
“Tolstoï has a clear, penetrating mind, especially
tolerant of such as think otherwise, and of an angelic
goodness. He reads everything, is interested in everything,
and in his conversation does not attempt any propaganda. 
Poorly clad, half in rags, he lives in his family,
which does not share in his convictions, but which
honors and idolizes him. His wife is an intelligent
woman, an excellent mistress of her house, a house
which is kept up in grand style. The sons, practical
men, take care of the estate. The daughter is beautiful,
worldly; in her very elegant costume she goes out to
walk with her half-dressed father, and worships him.”

The people who surround him at the present time
consist of three classes: the half-mad, who see in him
what they want to see, and who get out of his words
what they wish. In the second place, the good-for-nothings, 
who come to profit by his benevolent disposition, 
and who are often discontented, since he cannot
satisfy all their demands. Finally, the correspondents
of the different newspapers, who write about him
entirely according to the tendency of the paper to which
they contribute.

Tolstoï teaches, above everything else, that people
ought to be happy just as they ought to be pure. To
be happy we must have as few necessities as possible.
Hence the return to the primitive condition, which he
finds in the life of the peasant, which is so simple.

The moralizing propensity has been strong in Tolstoï
from the beginning. It is always to be found in his
writings, except, perhaps, in some of his very earliest
little stories, like “Lucerne.” It is unmistakable in
“War and Peace;” it is very strongly stamped on
“Anna Karénina,” where it even weakens the result.
The moral lesson which we should deduce appears quite
too distinctly in his sketches. In other words: the fixed
idea of the generations of the past is traced here; the
idea of punishment: thus it goes, when, etc. Cause and
effect, without its being expressly so stated, become
transformed to guilt and punishment.

Of late Tolstoï has devoted his efforts to writing
for the people. He has determined to turn to the
hundred million instead of to the upper ten thousand.
He has written a series of short narrative legends, symbolical 
stories and tales, which from his disinterestedness 
are sold for about one cent (1½ kopeks) for each
number, and which are intended to give to the Russian
peasants and workmen, who are now, for the first time,
awakening from a sleep of a thousand years, the food
which is suited to their minds and the ideas which they
need.

These brief writings are not reading for us who have
a different culture. But the great peasant drama of last
year, “The Power of Darkness,” stands far above these
didactic sheets. Perhaps it is the masterpiece of this
great eccentric and independent thinker. By its poetic
meaning it belongs to the literature of the world, nay,
so far as the dramatic literature is concerned, marks the
discovery of a new world of material.

Although this play has the wonderful quality that
there is not a single repartee which cannot be
understood by the ignorant and untaught, it is food for the
most cultured.

It is a peculiarity of Tolstoï, with his lack of
scientific endowments, that his thought is not able to
penetrate the economical causes of unhappiness and misery.
No one who has read his essay “On the Importance of
Art and Science,” that is, its unimportance, this attempt
of a self-taught moralist to pass judgment on things
which are out of the scope of his intellect, will be
surprised that Tolstoï regards money as the root of all
evil. With his own hand he does all sorts of service for
the poor; but he never assists them with money. He
wastes his time in helping an old woman set up her
stove, but does not give her the ruble or two which she
needs to get the stove set up better and more solidly.

He is himself rich and has a large income, but he makes
use of the expression that money affairs belong to the
domain of his wife. He never has any money about him,
only now and then gets from his home fifteen kopeks to
pay for a bath in one of the bath-houses for the common
people.

In the play “The Power of Darkness” there is a trace
of this eccentricity. We notice Akim’s indignation when
Mitritch explains to him how it is that money put in the
bank draws interest. All matters of interest and of
banks are in his view a delusion. The author is to be
heard here through the old peasant.

Otherwise, with exemplary self-control he keeps
himself concealed behind his characters, and the play is a
great work in its exceptional sense of reality and the
great, kind heart which beats in it.

Here we look into a world where no one has the bearings, 
where no one really knows anything about what
lies beyond the confines of the country town, not even
the soldier who has roamed about. And how the women
are regarded can be seen from what is said about them
in one of the conversations: “There are millions of them
in the Russian land, and all as blind as moles; no
knowledge but a little superstition; when they die, they are
just as wise as when they were born.”

It is against this “Power of Darkness” that Tolstoï
has directed the beams of light from the blaze of his
fantasy and his enthusiasm. It is with this that he, as
the educator of the people, has begun the fight. Behind
his Asgaard’s wall he kindles the bright fire into which
the Spirit of Darkness, the giant in the Eagle’s home, is
to fall in the future.<footnote>Tolstoï’s works have been translated into Danish, German, French,
and English.</footnote>

In the Russian monograph “Count L. N. Tolstoï and
a Criticism of his Works,” we have collected all the
portraits extant of the great author. There is a group of
the year 1856, in which the young officer is painted with
Grigoróvitch, Gontcharóf, Turgenief, and Druzhínin, and
the keen author of comedies, Ostrovski, and another of
the year 1857, in which the group consists of Turgenief,
Sollogub, Tolstoï, Niekrásof, Grigoróvitch, and Panayef.
There is an admirable portrait by Kramskoï, and a great
many photographs from later years.

We can thus trace how this characteristic head has
been moulded and developed from within. There is the
officer, not yet thirty years old, with the military
mustache and the regularly cut, smooth hair, and the already
peculiar, discontented, penetrating look, the expressive
mouth, querying and uncertain, — a face which shows
uneasiness, betraying a shy and violent spirit. All the
others seem so tame, so mild by the side of him,
capricious as he seems, and naïf and defiant.

Years roll on, developments take place, and this head
becomes changed. A quality appears in it which
conquers all the others: commanding power. In the later
pictures this expression becomes very strong. There is
Kramskoï’s portrait, when Tolstoï was between forty
and fifty years of age, with the smooth, black hair 


falling in waves over the temples, the heavy, dark, full
beard, which covers his throat and collar, with an
expression of concentrated depth of understanding and
strength. There is no more uncertainty about this
mouth, no uneasiness in the brow; the look is the look
of the seer and of the thinker penetrating into the very
marrow of things. Then there is the portrait of Tolstoï
at his writing-desk, a wonderful picture from the
greatness of his style and bearing. The greatest gravity and
absorption shine out from it. Every one who sees the
portrait feels that what that man writes is not vanity, is
not idle words, but strong, mighty words, worth
pondering over. And there is still one later portrait, where
the expression of the eyes and about the mouth comes
very near to being frightful, appalling, it is so strong
and commanding. The heavy eyebrows almost seem to
threaten; the thick beard, growing freely, and
besprinkled with gray, reminds one of the old prophets.

In the series of illustrations in the book come also
the latest portraits : the well-known photograph of the
sixty-year-old Tolstoï as a muzhik, in the dark blouse of
the peasant, with the leather belt around his waist, with
his hair parted in the middle of his forehead in the
fashion of the Russian peasant, with his forehead
furrowed with deep wrinkles curving down in the middle,
the dishevelled, snow-white beard, extending almost down
to where the arms are crossed upon the breast, and the
anxious look of the mystic, whose firmness reminds us
of the gaze of the careworn.

Last of all is Riepin’s masterly painting, which is
also known in other lands from the chromo-lithographs:
a broad field with a background of woods; peasants are
ploughing in the middle distance; in the foreground
Tolstoï as a peasant is ploughing in the Russian style,
with a white horse harnessed to an antique wooden
plough, leading by a halter another white horse behind
him, which draws the harrow. For it is Leo Nikolayevitch 
himself, this strong, broad-shouldered frame,
with the soft white hat, which protects the sunken eyes
from the sun, with the blue peasant’s-frock, open about
the neck, exposing his naked breast, and the high boots,
which sink in the rich mould. There is nothing here
which reminds one of the count, of the born aristocrat.
The thick, broad nose, the heavy jaws, are those of the
Russian peasant. But what a wonderful peasant! this
bearing, this immense force in simplicity! It is the
peasant in contemplation, as a hero, as a genius, as a
civilizer. It is the Scythian prince of Herodotus,
Kola-Xais, the Prince of the Ploughshare; it is Mikula, the
child of the village, the hero of agriculture, with the
wonderful plough, who draws his furrow rich in
blessings in the boundless Russian plain. It is the national
hero Ilia of Murom himself, risen from his death of
a thousand years to cultivate again the Russian soil and
earth, — he who, stronger than fate, went on the road to
riches and “did not become rich,” but was wholly
engrossed in the fundamental Russian idea of
community.

Thus with Tolstoï we turn back to our first impression 
of Russian intellectual life and literature. He, to
whom Turgenief directed his last words written with a
pencil, and whom, when dying, he addressed as “my
friend, the great author of Russia!” he in our days is
the last great one of the group of cultivators in this
immense empire.

What is it that he cultivates? what is it that all
these, young and old, the men with good will, prepare
and cultivate?
