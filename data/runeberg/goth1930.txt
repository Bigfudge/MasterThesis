<h2><small>Preface.</small></h2>

Many tourists think there is nothing to see in 
Gothenburg and therefore continue their journey to other
parts of Sweden as quickly as possible. We have
however been requested by several tourists who have
visited Gothenburg and been delighted with it to
publish a booklet in English, giving a few plain facts
about Gothenburg and its seaside and inland 
watering places. Therefore we adopt the slogan ”Say
it with Pictures” and accordingly place a selection
before you with all kinds of information, more 
especially about summer and winter sports etc. As this
is the first edition <b>we should be very pleased to
receive criticism and suggestions in order to improve
the next edition</b> which we intend to publish later on.

We take this opportunity of referring tourists and
business men to the ”Port of Gothenburg Year Book
1930” just published by the Harbour Engineers
Torsten Hultin and Gustaf Westberg, giving all
details of the Harbour as the centre of Shipping to
all parts of the World from Sweden and other 
Scandinavian countries. For further particulars about
Gothenburg we refer to the guide book, written by
the late Stadsrevisor Axel Ramm and translated into
English by the Rev. Charles Baldwin, formerly
Chaplain of St. Andrew’s English Church and also
English Vice-Consul. This book can be obtained at
any book <b>shops or stores</b> in Gothenburg.

A Pocket Guide to Gothenburg, issued free by the
Swedish American Line can be obtained at their
offices in America and Sweden.

Gothenburg, May 1930. ”Still going strong.”

<h2><small>”Come to Sweden”</small></h2>

is a slogan cry, made to the wide world and applies
to all who read this booklet. The call is made to
those who are jaded through the stress and turmoil
of these troublesome times, to those who need to
keep physically fit, to those who are healthy and
simply require a bracing holiday in the happiest
surroundings.

All through the year Sweden attracts and welcomes
visitors of all classes and tastes. It pleases everyone.
There you will find everything which helps to make
a holiday enjoyable Sunshine: Ozon-laden air from
the Sea and Pine forests and always the real Holiday
Spirit amongst the most hospitable people.

The coming events in Sweden for this season will
be the Swedish Fair at Gothenburg between the 10th
and 18th May 1930, and the Exhibition at Stockholm
from 16th May to the end of September 1930, when
tourists will be specially catered for

Few countries in the world are able to offer the
visitor a more changing nature than Sweden. The
great extent of the country from Oeresund in the
South to far above the arctic circle in the North
involves interesting differences in landscape, climate
and national character. The level, fertile county of
Skåne with its beech groves, hamlets and historical
castles, the west coast with its granite rocks washed
by the ocean, interesting fishing villages and watering
places, the blue lakes of Södermanland, the forestclad
hills of Wärmland, the smiling nature of Dalarne and
the mighty rivers and rushing torrents, snowcovered
mountains and miles upon miles of wilderness of
Norrland — all of this offers the traveller scenery
of the most changing kind.

Sweden, however, is not only a tourist country of
great beauty, but also a country of pronounced 
industrial character offering the technical and 
commercial man much of interest. The vast natural
resources of the country, viz. timber and iron ore,
together with an abundance of water power, have
created a production which covers not only the home
requirements but also permit of an appreciable export.
The Swedish industrial products have gained a good
reputation abroad owing to their high quality and
first-class manufacture.


<img></img>  
There is, therefore, nothing astonishing in the fact
that an ever increasing number of strangers come to
visit the Swedish Industries Fair in Gothenburg. At
the same time as a visit to the Swedish Industries
Fair in Gothenburg may prove of good benefit from
a business standpoint, there will also be an 
opportunity to study some of the beautiful parts of Sweden.

  Gothenburg, the second in size of the cities of
Sweden and its largest port, occupies a central 
position and can be reached by rail in 6 or 7 hours from
the capitals of the three Scandinavian countries,
Copenhagen, Oslo, and Stockholm. The quickest
route from the middle of Europe goes via Sassnitz—
Trelleborg, and the western part of Europe is in
railway communication with Gothenburg via 
Warnemünde—Gjedser—Copenhagen—Helsingborg.         
By means of regular steamship lines the city is in
frequent connection with Great Britain, America,
Canada and most ports of any importance in the
world commerce. The Gothenburg aero port is one
of the few with accomodation for receiving aeroplanes
as well as hydroplanes.

  Good connections are established between 
Gothenburg and other parts of Sweden. No less than seven
railway lines radiate from the city to various parts
of the country. The Bergslags Railway runs to 
Trollhättan, and up to the industrial districts of Värmland
and Dalarne and further on to Stockholm. By the
comfortable steamers of the »Sveabolaget» one also
gets an opportunity of having an agreeable trip from
Gothenburg round the coast to Stockholm and to
the ports of Northern Sweden. From here the trip
can be extended to Lapland, the land of the raging
rivers and the midnight sun.
<img><i>»Kronhuset», the oldest building in Gothenburg</i></img>

Gothenburg, with its 250,000 inhabitants, is the
most important as well as the largest seaport in
Sweden. It is situated at that point where the Göta
Älv, the biggest river in the south of Sweden,
empties itself into the Cattegat. Judged by 
continental standards Gothenburg is a comparatively
young city. It is but a very few years ago that the
great Jubilee Exhibition, the fame of which travelled
to all corners of the earth, celebrated the three
hundredth anniversary of the city’s birth. So far back
in history as the Viking period several highly 
important trade routes here converged and merchants
from many lands met for the transaction of their
business.

Quite naturally therefore, with such a commercial
tradition behind it, Gothenburg was the first city in
Sweden to inaugurate that essential adjunct to modern
commerce, an Industries Fair.

<img><i>Svenska Mässans Utställningshallar, Göteborg</i></img>  

Foreigners, intending to pay a visit to Sweden, have
during recent years more and more had their attention
drawn to the Swedish Industries Fair in Gothenburg,
which is held every year during the month of May
and lasts for nine days and it has been found that
a stay in Sweden of short or long duration, no matter
whether in connection with business or simply a
tourist trip or both combined, can be commenced
with a visit to the Fair.


<img></img>  
 In the large and modern Fair Halls with a floor
 area of about 30,000 square metres and with nothing
 to equal them in the northern part of Europe, the
 visitor will get an idea in a concentrated form of
 what Sweden can produce in various branches of
 industry. The Fair is conveniently arranged under
 the main groups of Swedish products, thus making
 it easy for the visitor to find anything of special
 interest to him.

   Last year the number of exhibitors was 600, 
representing about 1,000 Swedish manufacturers. The
 visitors numbered more than 101,000 from 25
 countries. The Fair is of a purely national character.

   The most prominent feature of this year’s Fair will
 be the <b>industrial section</b>. This will centre around
 those particular industries which have long been
 regarded as essentially Swedish, particulary the
 <b>manufacture of machinery</b> and <b>other metal products,
 electric apparatus and timber in its many forms.</b>

   The <b>textile</b> as well as the <b>fur, footgear</b> and <b>leather
 industries</b> will also be well represented.

   A speciality will be the exhibition of furs. At
 present there are about 800 farms for breeding fur
 animals such as Silver-fox, Blue-fox, Crossed-fox
 etc., even Mink (weasel tribe), racoon, rabbits. There
 will also be an exhibition of food, literature how to
 rear animals etc.

Sweden has over 9,000 miles of railway 
supplemented by an excellent system of canals. About 
one-third of her railways are state owned. The Electric
trains between Stockholm and Gothenburg do the
journey in 5 hours and 44 minutes, distance being
458 kilomters or 284<small><sup>1</sup></small>/<small><sub>2</sub></small> Engilsh miles. This railway
is the longest electric railway in Europe, the carriages
being of the bogie wagon Pullman Corridor saloon
type and very comfortable with lounge chairs on the
day trains, even on third class carriages.

Restaurant cars with excellent cuisine are attached
to all the principal day-trains. The carriages are very
clean and well ventilated and heated during the 
winter which adds to the comfort. If the windows are
open there is no dust, soot, smoke or steam from the
locomotives even if passing through a tunnel.

Reservation of Seats in the principal trains from
and to Gothenburg can be made one hour before
the train starts.

The reservation fee being 25 öre for each seat.

will obtain fine views of Lake Venern and Läckö
Castle.

Grävsnäs Castle is at Grävsnäs Station.

The Cathedral at Skara is an historical sight well
worth seeing, after which a trip to Varnhem’s Abbey
(where the old kings’ graves are) and from 
Lundsbrunns bath and water-cure establishment to Husaby
old church and S. Sigfrid’s Well is recommended.

One can arrive at Läckö Castle situated on a
headland in Lake Venern by steamer either from
Lidköping or Kinnekulle.

For shorter trips from Gothenburg we can 
recommend Björboholm. During the summer there is a
good restaurant with a glorious view over Lake
Mjörn from the lofty eminence. There is good 
skiing here during the winter.

A circuit journey through Sweden has been 
arranged by <b>Göteborgs-Tidningen</b>, starting from 
Gothenburg to Dalecarlia via Ludvika and further to 
Stockholm, where most visitors will probably break their
journey; afterwards continuing to Älvsjö-Nynäshamn
via Visby to Kalmar. Those who have previously
been to Gotland or those who do not wish to go
there, have the possibility of travelling by Svea

Office and German Church by Aero Materiel A.B. No. C. 792.</i></img>

Company’s steamer along the coast to Kalmar;
afterwards completing the journey to 
Emmaboda—Alvesta—Gothenburg. The whole trip costs only
Kr. 33:10. There are possibilities to travel second
or first-class, at considerably reduced prices. One
has the right to choose which way to make the
journey. If anyone wishes to proced to Visby first
and then to Stockholm and Dalecarlia they are at
liberty to do so. The date for starting the journey
is optional and the tickets are available for 3 months
during July, August and September. The journey
may start from any station »en route». Tourists are
allowed to break their journey at several places
without any extra cost, and may visit other districts
which lie close to the route at reduced rates. 
Dalecarlia with Lake Siljan and Rättvik ought to entice
a few to break the journey, also Fryken Lakes in
Vermland. It is also the intention to obtain some
advantages in connection with the Stockholm 
Exhibition.

Further particulars can be obtained at 
Handels-Tidningens Central in Gothenburg, and from

<h2><small>Steamship routes from Gothenburg. 1930.</small></h2>

There is no rise and fall of the tide in Sweden
(the difference between high and low water being
only about 0,2 metres or eight inches) so that Ocean
steamers can enter or leave the Port of Gothenburg
at any time day or night. Steamers can lie at anchor
outside the Harbour close to Långedrag (the Yachting
Club’s harbour) and thus be free from harbour dues,
but must pay small fees for lighthouses etc. 
Långedrag is well protected from the open sea owing to
the numerous skerries (islands). Tourists can visit
Gothenburg via Långedrag in motor launches which
take about 10 minutes from the steamers to the
landing stage and then by electric tramcars or taxis
which take respectively 30 and 15 minutes.

Owing to no tide yachtsmen, rowing and canoeing
clubs, bathers, fishing and all other kinds of summer
and winter sports can be indulged in at any time.
We recommend Shipowners to obtain a copy of the
”Port of Gothenburg Year Book” recently published
for all information concerning port charges, depth of
water etc.

<h3>Keiller’s Park.</h3>

   Visitors should make a point of seeing Keiller’s
Park (given by the late James Keiller 1907) situated
on Ramberget, the highest point of which is 260 feet
above sea level and the view from which is quite
remarkable. The main eminence is, in reality, two
separate hills, Stora Ramberget, composed of Granite
and gneiss respectively. A new ”Board School” has
been erected in the vicinity of the Park as well as
numerous workmen’s houses, built at the expense of
the municipality; there are also many allottement
gardens for the working classes close to the Park.

                                 <img>Keillers Park</img>

    The top can easily be reached by motor car in
 about 8 minutes from the centre of the city, on the
 way crossing the river — ”Göta Älv” — and passing
 the Free Harbour by Motor buses.

    The top of Keillers Park would be a suitable place
 for a monument in the shape of a lighthouse which
 is needed partly for aero-traffic and partly so that
 tourists can obtain a better view of the City. It
 ought to be provided with a protected tower for
 rainy weather and also have a lift or elevator. At
 least many tourists have suggested this idea.

tourists.

   The new locks, four in number, are each 89 metres
long, 13.<small>7</small> metres wide and 5.<small>5</small> metres deep. The
dimensions of the most modern of the earlier locks,
which these replaced, were 35.<small>6</small>, 7.<small>4</small> and 2.<small>9</small>. The series
of locks, one at Rannumfallet, four at Trollhättan and
one at Lilla Edet cost about 23 million kronor.

  The resources of the
available waterfalls of
Sweden, are estimated to
be 6,200,000 turbine horse

about 1050 horsepower
per 1000 inhabitants as
compared to 382 for
Switzerland, 152 for Italy,
147 for France and 11 for

<h3>Westrogothian Tour.</h3>

   An easy, convenient-, and highly interesting route
is the tourist motorbus line, the ”<b>Westrogothian
Line</b>”, Gothenburg—Lidköping—Jönköping and vice
versa. This line touches many of the places mentioned
in the foregoing.

   The starting=point of this line is Gothenburg,
whence the route northward follows the western bank
of the Göta Älv past the castle of Bohus, and thence
to the Falls of Trollhättan, previously mentioned.
From here the route skirts the southern shore of Lake
Vänern as far as the extreme point of Kallandsö,
where the castle of Lackö rears its towers and 
embattlements, continuing thence via the old Väner town
of Lidköping to Mt. Kinnekulle and to the interesting
mediaeval church at Husaby.

   From Kinnekulle the route runs due south
traversing the wide plain "Västgötaslätten" to Skara,
the most renowned town in the province, thence in
an easterly direction, passing the abbey of Varnhem,
and right across the heights of Billingen by way of
the remarkable rift-valley, on to the town of Skövde.

   The next stage of the journey is to the town of
Hjo, whence one obtains a charming view of Lake
Vättern. The route from here follows the Vättern
shore, which rises steadily as one proceeds further
south—all the time the views becoming ever wider
and wider—and finally past Habo church to the town
of Jönköping.

   The total length of the "Westrogothian line" is
377 kilometres, or about 234 miles.

<img></img>

   The »Westrogothian line» is maintained by The Göta Canal Steamship Co. In Jönkoping the
motorbus connects conveniently with the passenger steamers to and from Stockholm, thus enabling
tourists to make an extremely interesting tour.

Station of 10 students from Eton College who arrived
in Gothenburg on the 7th April by the T/S

   They were the guests of the Rotary Club and were
invited to lunch at the Palace Hotel, before 
proceeding by the mid-day train to Storlien to practice
ski-ing. During their return journey via Stockholm
they were interviewed by a reporter and said: »We
have had a splendid time. The weather was lovely
also the sleighing. We were exceedingly struck with
the majestic mountain nature; and the clear winter
air which was very invigorating. We were also on
top of some mountains, among these Blåhammer took
the prize for beauty and magnificence. There were
other things which were enjoyable for instance »The
food, the delicate food» they all called out in one
voice »we shall never forget the food! Now we are
returning to Eton and Marlborough. It is the first
time we have been in Sweden, but it will not be the
last. They returned via Gothenburg on April 26th
by the same steamer.

  Gothenburg Electric Trams are fine Pulman
Cars painted light blue and white (the City colours)
and there are no advertisements inside the cars which
makes them artistic and pleasant. The Driver’s
platform is covered in with large glass windows, so
that he is protected from the rain, snow and cold
during the winter. The cars have letter boxes
attached at the back for the public to post their letters
and these are emptied continually as the cars pass
the General Post Office. There are also boxes to
receive passengers’ tickets as they leave the cars,
instead of throwing them into the streets as is done
in other cities.

  Transfer tickets to other lines both for tramcars
and motor buses can be obtained, but passengers
must request these when paying their fare. In order
to get localised in Gothenburg we recommend a tour
by the different lines and back to the starting point,
the total cost will be about Kr. 3:50 for all the
ten lines.

<chapter name="Marstrand">
<img></img>                      
<h3>Marstrand.</h3>

   <b>Marstrand</b>, the oldest town in Bohuslän next to
the famous <b>Kungahälla</b>, mentioned as early as in
beginning of the 13th century and destroyed by the
Hansards in 1368. During the following years,
owing to the herring fishery, Marstrand was one of
the richest towns of the North. During summer a
very gay and motley life unfolds itself here, for
Marstrand is the most frequented seaside resort in
Sweden. The fortress looks now as it did hundreds
of years ago. From the Tower, which is 128 feet high,
is a splendid view of the archipelago. The Marstrand
bathingetablishment was founded in 1822. The now
existing buildings are however of a later date.
Among the hotels may be mentioned the partly 
reconstructed Turisthotel with view of the harbour,
the Stadshotel and St. Eriks Hotel. Restaurant 
Alphyddan, near the club-house and bath-house park,
commands from its upper dining-hall a view of
the sea.

   There is a chute or switch back into the water at the
Bath establishment and a lighter full of sand so that
guests can lie in the sun. The water contains between
2 and 3½ % salt. At the warm bath-house there are
seaweed, mud and soap massage-baths, turkish and
electric baths also Nauheimer and Kreuznacherbaths.

<h3>Gustaf Adolf’s Day. (6th Nov. 1927.)</h3>

       The 6th November every year is a great day for school children, who all march (each carrying a Swedish National Flag) to Gustaf Adolf’s Torg or Square, to commemorate the anniversary of the death of this great monarch, the founder of Gothenburg. The children sing national songs, accompanied by military bands, speeches are made by City Councillors and others. The City is decorated with flags and lit up at night by coloured electric lamps, torch lights etc., and national rejoicings take place all over the City.

<img><i>Gustaf Adolf’s Day (6th Nov. 1929).</i></img>
<img></img>

  Järntorgsbrunnen, (The Fountain at the Iron market
place). There is a history in the memory of bygone
days brought to mind by the middle part of the
fountain, the prominent irombowl. On this will be
found a facsimile of the trade marks of the old iron
mines, the shipment of which took place from Gothenburg. 
The importance of the export of Swedish iron
played an important part in the history of our
country and the City’s economy, as in the 17th
century Sweden had a larger production of iron than
any other country in the world.

<img><i>Iron Market Square (Järntorget)</i></img>

   To help the export of this article a weighingscale
was built in Carl IX’s time in the year 1680 which
gave rise to the name ”Järntorget”. The five figures
of nude women symbolise the five parts of the world
to which the iron was shipped and the hope that
the same may continue in the future.

   An avenue of trees called, ”The Allée”, begins at
”Fattighusån” and curving through Kings Park ends
at Järntorget (The Iron Market Place) a distance of
1,8 kilometers, or a little more than one English mile.

out on the rocks reading: ”At this place the solar
eclipse of 29 July 1861 was observed by C. B. Airy,
Astronomer Royal of Greenwich.”

   This is a suitable place for tourists and others to
obtain one of the finest views of the City.

<h3>Statistics and Sport.</h3>

   ”Get off the beaten track” by trying a trip to
unknown Sweden for all kinds of sport or a quiet
rest at one of the many Hydros.

   Sweden is undoubtedly a fine country for sport
which is unknown to American and British 
sportsmen because the Swedes have not understood how
to advertise their country in the same manner as
Norway and Switzerland have done.

   Our advice is <b>book only to Gothenburg</b> and on
arrival you can always find  out from the Travel
Bureaux (our firm only act as guides and  interpreters
but we are willing to help you with free advice) where
the best sport can be obtained for the kind you are
most interested in.

   No less than 8 percent of the surface of Sweden
is water, the lakes covering 14,000 sq. miles,
Norwegian lakes 3,000 sq. miles, (Vänern, the largest
lake is 2,150 sq. miles). The length of Lake Vänern
is about 100 miles compared to Loch Lomond in
Scotland 24 miles, and Lake Windermere in 
England is 11 miles long. The length of Sweden is
nearly 1,000 miles and over 400 miles broad, while
its area is 170,644 sq. miles, or about three times the
size of England and Wales. The Swedish islands
cover in all an area of 3,000 square miles, and the
length of the coast is about 3,000 miles.

<img><i>Gothenburgs Stadion near Slottsskogen</i></img>

   The highest mountain is Kebnekaise 7,000 feet high
as compared to Snowden 3560 feet (in England and
Wales). In the same district are to be found the
greatest waterfalls: Stora Sjöfallet (Great Lake Falls)
2,200 feet across and 130 feet high, and Harsprånget
(The Hare’s Leap) a chain of falls and rapids about
980 feet in length and with a total height of 240 feet.
Among the mountain lakes one of the largest is
Torneträsk, 82 sq. miles in area. There are also
some 200 glaciers.

   Of the North-Swedish rivers the Muonio-Torneälv
has a length of 350 miles compared to the Thames
250 miles; the Luleälv, along the course of which
occur the above-mentioned falls, is 280 miles long.

   Sweden is 12 times the size of Switzerland so that
you have better opportunities for good sport in
Sweden and you will find the Swedes <b>worthy 
sportsmen</b> to compete against.

   Rainfall in Norway 40 to 70 in. annually. The
rainfall in Sweden is greatest on the shores of the
Cattegat 30 inches yearly. Norrland with a winter
of 8 months only 16 inches. The average rainfall
for London is less than 24 inches (604 mm.) in
twelve months, in Edinburgh, a trifle more, and in
Dublin 27 inches (696 mm.).

<img><i>Styrsö bathing and yachting resort</i></img>

   From these statistics you will understand there are
plenty of opportunities for all kinds of sport (cricket
excepted) both in summer and winter and as there
is no fall and rise of the tide this is a great plus for
sailing and bathing and also a great help for winter
sports by the formation of ice.

   There are 15 Hydros in Sweden open during the
winter months with good accomodation, from three
guineas per week inclusive. Central heating. Electric
light. Bedrooms with hot and cold water. Spacious
public rooms. The following are close to 
Gothenburg: Ed, Hindås, Hultafors, Mösseberg and 
Ulricehamn. Massage and electrical treatment.

   There are 38 Hydros open during the summer
months with spa waters, good bathing etc. The
attendants at these establishments are specially and
medically trained.

            <h3>Football.</h3>

   West Ham United football matches against
Gothenburg combined team will take place on 6th
and 11th June at Gothenburg, against Stockholm on
8th June 1930 at Stockholm, against Helsingborg on

the members who have paid their subscriptions, their
receipt being considered as a lot. The annual
subscription is 10 kr. for ladies and 20 kr. for
gentlemen.

   Slottsskogen (The Castle Forest) is a public park
which was presented to the City in 1624 but sold
and repurchased in 1874.

   It embraces 140 hectares or 346 acres and contains
a deer park and water-fowl ponds, seal pond and a
few bears. The park is well lit up at night by
electric lamps and open day and night. There is a
medallion portrait of August Kobb (died 1902) who
was foremost in promoting it as a people’s park.
Close to the memorial is Björngårdsvilla, a summer
restaurant at which the waitresses are dressed in
Swedish National Costumes. Good music. A little
way up the slope is a seal pond with its lively
inhabitants.

   This slope is used in winter as a toboggan run and
close to it is Bragebacken (see photo) a declivity,
which was laid out in 1922 as a course for skiving
competitions.

   There is a second restaurant called ”Vita bandet”
(the White Ribbon) a temperance restaurant.

   A fine view of the Cattegat can be obtained from
the Water Tower (see photo) called Utsikten.

   Motor Cars are not allowed to drive through this
park after 4 o’clock in the afternoon nor on Sundays.

Any country within the Artie Circle may be called »Land
of the Midnight Suns, but with the exception of the 
Scandinavian countries these regions are practically uninhabited,
being also rather cold, even in the middle of summer.
Scandinavia is an exception to this rule. About 150 miles of
