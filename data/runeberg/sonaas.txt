DURING the last few years of the period
1860—70 and the beginning of the
succeeding decade, there arose in
Sweden a movement which, having at first
a purely political-economical character,
was finally transformed into a pedagogic
question. In the countries of the North,
the light nights of the short summers
are soon succeeded by long, dark winter
evenings. The agricultural population cannot then work in
the fields and meadows but, in accordance with the custom
of their forefathers, these people are obliged at such times
to find employment within the four walls of their cottages.
Here, in olden times, the members of each family — 
and amongst this number the servants were also included
— gathered readily around the stone-hearth, upon which
a warm, bright fire of large logs blazed merrily and, to
the strains of a ballad or a hymn, or while listening
to one of the many northern legends of giants and
hobgoblins, of brave champions and fair maidens, each
one’s fingers were busied with some suitable occupation.
The men, for example, made rake-pegs, axe-helves, spoons,
ladles, benches, tables and other articles necessary for
farm-work or the home, often ornamenting each object 
with simple and tasteful designs, while the women
tended the spinning-wheel and the loom, or stitched
some article of dress
intended for their own use
or that of the men. Such
work, executed with
simple aids by persons not
belonging to any guild,
has in Sweden for
long ages gone by the
name of <i>sloyd</i> (Swed.
<i>slöjd</i>).
<img><small>Original Sloyd</small></img>
But in consequence of many co-operating causes,
this skill in sloyd had by degrees begun to diminish
and, in some places, even to die out and disappear. Much
of the work which in former ages had been executed
in the homes of the peasantry was now taken up by
the rising manufacturing industries, and the improved
communications — railroads, canals, etc. rendered it
considerably easier for the country population to procure
those articles which they had previously been obliged
to make with their own hands. Such cultural progress,
however, always unavoidably bears with it certain
disadvantages and dangers. It is certainly true that,
when work within the family is changed to work
inside a factory, and when handicrafts are transformed
into machinery work, a certain saving of time can be
reckoned upon, but time saved becomes time <i>gained</i>
first when it is profitably employed. If, on the contrary,
this be not the case; if the hour which was before
devoted to productive activity is now spent in idleness
or, what is most surely worse, in drunkenness and
other wrong-doing, then the hour saved becomes an
hour <i>lost</i>, and that not only from a moral, but also from 
a political-economical point of view. People came to
an insight of this in Sweden some 35 years ago, and
it was the reason that they tried to take such
measures as should reinstate the sloyd of their forefathers
in the honorable position which is its proper due.

Whether it be a question of spreading any new
knowledge, any new kind of work, or of reviving that which
is on the verge of extinction, we can, as is well known,
go to work for the most part in two different ways. 
We can endeavor to influence either that part of the
population which is already come to adult age, or that
part which is still growing up; to influence either the
generation that <i>is</i>, or the generation that <i>will be</i>. Thence
comes, on the one hand, the forming of associations,
the giving of lectures, the arrangement of courses and,
on the other, the founding of schools for children,
where they shall enjoy an education so ordered that
it endeavors to prevent the deficiencies of the present
day from becoming those
of the future also. This
latter method will, probably, 
prove to be the surest
one on the whole; for the
mind of the child is, as we
know, always more receptive 
than that of the mature
man, and a foundation
should, therefore, be laid at
an early date for each branch
of knowledge. As surely as the future belongs to the
rising generation, so surely should each religious,
political, social and economical question be finally solved 
as a question of education. Good schools, therefore, are
the best gift a preceding period can give to a future.

Amongst the “sloyd-schools” thus established during
the period we have mentioned, that at <i>Nääs</i> was one
of the earliest. Nääs is an estate
situated in the government-district 
of Elfsborg, about 18 miles
from Gothenburg. This old
property, the main-building of which
is said by tradition to have served
as a royal huntingseat during the
15th century, was 35 years ago
in the possession of <i>August
Abrahamson</i>, who had retired to the
place in order to enjoy the fruits
of an industrious life. Abrahamson, 
who was born December
29th, 1817, at Karlskrona in the south of Sweden, came to
Gothenburg at the age of 14, and in 1840 founded an
import firm which
gradually became one of
the largest of its kind
in Sweden. After having 
amassed a fortune,
a somewhat
considerable one from a
Swedish point of view,
he relinquished the
business to others in
1868 and took up his
residence at Nääs. Here, assisted by his nephew, the
present administrator and director of the Institution, he
established in 1872 the <i>Nääs sloyd-school for boys</i>, which

<img><small>Vänhem</small></img>
commenced its work in the early days of February
of the year mentioned, with 16 pupils. Two years
later a similar educational institution was opened for girls.

The Nääs Sloyd-school for boys had, at first, to labor
in what was almost unbroken ground; both as regards
the aim of the instruction and its means. It is therefore 
self-evident that during the first few years it was
necessary to confine the attempts made to mere gropings
after right methods. It is seldom in this world that a
Minerva springs fully grown and fully armed from the
brain of Jupiter. But certain it is, however, that by
degrees the fundamental principles of the work assumed
a more definite form, and that these groping attempts
became a well planned and organized process. The
seeds, the beginnings, of what is now called the
<i>Nääs-system</i> and the <i>Nääs-method</i>, have indisputably existed
from a comparatively early period, though several years
were necessary ere they reached their present development. 
We shall therefore give some further account
of them in the following pages.

***

As we have previously mentioned, the <i>sloyd-instruction 
movement</i> on its first appearance was one having
political-economical ends as its chief aim. But it was
not to remain so long. For, almost at the same time
that those who were striving for the revival of sloyd
came to see that it was the child in its schoolage that
they should endeavor to influence, the friends of an
improved system of popular education began to have
their eyes opened to the fact that sloyd was an educational
means of the greatest value, well worth incorporating
with the theoretical and practical subjects of instruction
already adopted. The desire of the friends of sloyd 
to gain the assistance of the popular schools was thus
met half-way by the endeavors of the elementary
schools to obtain some advantage from the use of
sloyd. Resigned to, and received by the schools,
the sloyd question remained no longer a political-economical, 
but rather a <i>pedagogical one</i>, and one of ever
increasing scope. The attempt to use the school in order
to train sloyders was changed to the endeavor to use
sloyd in order to educate future men and women. The
school in the service of sloyd was changed to sloyd in
the service of the school. But this thought was by no
means new. The history of pedagogy can show that,
for centuries back, almost every pedagogue who stood
a head higher than the multitude, endeavored to maintain 
the importance of bodily labor as a mighty means
of education. Comenius, Francke, Locke, Rousseau,
Basedow, Salzmann, Pestalozzi, Fröbel, are as we know,
stars of the first magnitude in the art of education and
all of them have, though may be in different ways and
from somewhat varying points of view, given expression
to the opinion that the training of the hand should
proceed simultaneously with that of the head and the
heart. But, as is well known, it was first in our own
times that this thought has been understood and realized
to any very great extent.

In the first school at Nääs — the building was
opened in the summer of 1872 — instruction was at first
given 10 hours daily for a total of 50 weeks in the
year. Of these 10 hours, 7 were devoted to sloyd and
the other 3 to mathematics and geometrical drawing. 
This continued as long as the educational establishment
served more as a higher grade-school for the boys who
had already completed the courses at the elementary
school. But the necessity of lowering the limit of
age for entrance to the sloyd-school and the consequent
changes in the scheme of instruction there, arose in
the same degree that an insight was gained that
instruction in sloyd, conceived and arranged on pedagogic
grounds, should be fundamental in its work and should
not intrude upon the domain of special education. The
change was made in 1874, and the subjects of instruction 
became those fixed for the Swedish elementary
school — Christian doctrine, history and geography,
arithmetic and geometry, the Swedish language, natural science
and writing — and, in addition, geometrical drawing and
sloyd: carpentry, turning and wood-carving. In addition
to this school for boys, August Abrahamson established
one for girls in 1874 and a trade school in 1877. But
all these schools have, however, since been closed,
in order that the pedagogic activity at Nääs should 
be the better concentrated at a single educational
institution — the present Normal School for teachers of
Sloyd.

***

<img><small>Seminarium</small></img>

The necessity of special teachers, trained for the
purpose of giving instruction in sloyd, made itself felt
in the same degree as sloyd schools were established,
or as this instruction was introduced as a subject in
the elementary schools.
For this reason, a higher 
division was formed
at the Nääs sloyd-school 
for boys in the
autumn of 1874, the
object of which,
according to what was
then stated, should be
“to instruct and to train
young men who were
suitable to be employed as teachers, either in independent
sloyd-schools, or in such as were attached to elementary
schools.” It is from this higher division of the Nääs
sloyd-school that the present <i>Nääs Slöjdlärare Seminarium</i>
has gradually been developed. To gain admittance to
this educational establishment — long the only one, as
it was the first of its kind the applicants should have
reached the age of 18, have some previous acquaintance
with sloyd, especially carpentry, should be in possession
of knowledge equal to that enjoyed by those who had
completed their education at the elementary schools,
should not be afflicted by any such bodily deformity as
could render him unsuitable for employment as a teacher,
and should have certificates of good character. During 
the course, which lasted one year, instruction was given
in mathematics, natural science, pedagogics and school-method, 
drawing and sloyd; this latter branch of
instruction comprising carpentry, turning, wood-carving
and smithery. Other subjects were afterwards added — 
the Swedish language and the principles of physics
and mechanics. The last of these one-year courses
ended in April 1882: 62 sloydteachers had by that date
received certificates of competency.

***

<img><small>Sloydroom</small></img>

Beginning with the
year 1882 the Nääs
Seminarium for teachers of
sloyd entered upon an
entirely new stage by
the concentration of its
activity upon shorter
courses	intended for
teachers of both sexes, already engaged in the work of
instruction. Such teachers’ courses in <i>geometrical drawing</i>
had already been arranged at Nääs as early as 1874:
in 1878 these were changed to <i>courses in sloyd</i> which,
at first, were each of 5 weeks duration. As we have
already mentioned, the movement for instruction in
sloyd had been transformed from a political-economical
question to a pedagogic one, and the special teacher
of sloyd, the professional teacher, had thereby been
obliged to make way for the pedagogically trained
elementary teacher, the class teacher. When the plan of
the new arrangement at Nääs was made, the original
intention was to have eight courses annually, each course
being for 15 students.	By this means 120 teachers
could be trained annually. But the insight was soon 
gained that such a number of courses as eight could not
be advantageously arranged, for then several of them
must be held at a time when teachers in active service
could only with great difficulty be absent from their
schools. The number of courses given annually was,
therefore, limited in 1883 to six, in 1884 to five and,
finally, in 1886 to four, two of them being summer
courses and two being held in the winter. At this
number the courses for the present remain. For special
reasons, only 3 courses have been given during each
of the years 1898, 1899, 1901 and 1903. The extension
of the length of the courses from 5 weeks to 6, dates
its beginning from 1884. A further extension of time
would be certainly very desirable, but is rendered
impossible by the great difficulty the teachers would have,
in being away from home and school for a longer
period even should they themselves desire it, a state of
things which is by no means always the case. When
possible, the students in the first course of the year
have, however, been permitted to remain from two to
three or four weeks longer. Up to Course 13, July
19th—August 23, 1882, the courses had included only
men-students, but since the beginning of that course the
institution has admitted women-students too. From 1882
to 1889 the courses were for mixed classes on principle;
but in 1889 the change was made that only
women-students were admitted to one of the winter courses,
while to the other only men-students were accepted,
an arrangement which, it is true, proved to be
advantageous but which it has since been found better
to give up.

***

The following table shows the number of students
at the sloyd-courses held at the Seminary during the 
years 1875 —1903. The apparent decline in numbers
during the years 1898, 1899 and 1901 has clearly its
chiefest reason in the fact that in each of these years
there were but three courses held instead of four.

Another reason why the number of students in the
sloyd-courses has diminished is, that, since the
establishment of courses in games, gardening, school-kitchen
work, the preserving of fruit and in needlework, there has
been a demand upon the total number of beds available, for
the participants in these courses too.

It is true that an addition of these figures gives a
total of 5186, but as a good many students have taken part			
in two or more courses, and should thus rightly
be counted only <i>once</i>, the actual number of individual
students who have taken part in these sloyd-courses
up to the end of 1903 amounts to 3,909.

But these male and female teachers who go through
the courses do not, however, come entirely from Sweden
or even from
Scandinavia. For as early
as the close of the
“seventies” attention 
had been drawn
in other countries
to this peculiar
educational establishment 
in a country
district of Sweden. 
And not only have a
comparatively large number of foreign teachers of both
sexes taken part in these courses upon their own
initiative, but various governments have also sent
commissioners, or private competent persons to Nääs in
order to study the organization of and system of teaching
at the establishment. Such students came from Germany in
1880, France in 1882, Belgium in 1883, Russia in 1884,
Italy in 1887, the Argentine and Chili in 1889, Uruguay
in 1890, Brazil in 1891, Croatia in 1892, Roumania
and the Orange Free States in 1893, Hungary in 1894,
Bulgaria in 1895,
Ireland in 1897, Servia 
in 1898, and Egypt
and Greece in 1901. 
The 3,909 students
at the Courses represent 
35 different countries.

<img><small>Gymnastic Exercises</small></img>

The instruction at which attendance is compulsory given
during the courses is partly theoretical, partly practical. 
While the former
includes lectures and
discussions, the
latter is chiefly
represented by <i>sloyd</i>, <i>drawing</i>
and <i>gymnastics</i>. Let
us first give some
details concerning the
theoretical instruction. 
This consisted
at first of merely some
few pedagogical lectures, having as their object to make
clear to the student the aim and means of instruction in
sloyd; but from the beginning of the year 1881 regular
series of lectures were included in the programme of studies.
During the years 1881—1883 only <i>one</i> such series
was held, but in 1883 the change was made that the
lectures were divided into two parallel series, one <i>systematic</i> 
and one <i>historic</i>. Of these, the former treated
of the pedagogics and method of instruction in sloyd;
the latter dealt with its history and also with scenes
from the history of the art of general education, having
special reference to those pedagogues who had endeavored 
to accentuate the importance of bodily labor
for the education of youth. This plan was continued
until 1887, when the purely <i>methodic</i> division was
separated from the systematic lectures, thus giving rise
to three series. Since then, a partial union has again
taken place and the theoretical instruction during
different courses has been more concentrated, now upon
one branch, now upon another, of that widely extensive
subject “<i>the pedagogics of sloyd</i>”. Thus there are 
included fragments of general pedagogics and method,
of psychology, hygiene, esthetics, of the history of the art
of education, of the
technology of tools,
and of aught else
that stands in direct
connection with a
right understanding
and a correct
ordering of the
instruction in sloyd
given for the
purpose of education.
In addition to these lectures on the pedagogics of sloyd,
lectures are also given on general pedagogic subjects
but are given in Swedish only.

The form in which the lectures are given also varies,
sometimes the lecturer alone speaking and on other
occasions a kind of Socratic method being employed in
the shape of a conversation between the lecturer and
his hearers. The latter are expected to take notes
which can afterwards be used as the basis of a written
summary of the lesson. As a rule, the lectures are
given by the Director and, during the summer, this not
only in Swedish but also in English and German.
Included in the theoretical instruction are also discussions
of the opinions expressed during the lectures, and on
the forms and practical utility of the models. When
the weather permits, the theoretical part of the course
is held out of doors. Under all circumstances the
lectures are interrupted on suitable occasions for the singing
of some song or other, an arrangement which has proved
to be singularly effective.

<img><small>Lecture in the open air</small></img>

***

The work in the sloyd-rooms forms a whole with
the theoretical instruction. Although this work has a
greater number of hours devoted to it than have the
lectures and discussions, still, the execution of the
models is not to be regarded as the essential part of
the course but more as an elucidation of the method.
The teachers taking part in the courses obtain too, it
is true, the series of models which are intended to be
used as material for instruction in the schools. And,
of course, a certain dexterity in the handling of tools
and in the execution of work is also acquired, although
in such a comparatively short time as six or twelve
weeks any real skill in sloyd in the actual meaning of
the word can scarcely be aimed at. What can be
gained during that time in a technical respect is, at the
most, some prospect of being afterwards able to aquire
— either alone or under the direction of another — the
skill necessary for giving instruction in sloyd.

The work in the sloyd-rooms, of which there are
four, is carried on under the direction of the
headteacher in sloyd at the school. The direct instruction 
is given by assistant sloyd-teachers who are
appointed for each course. The fact that the assistant
teachers are not permanently appointed, facilitates in no
small degree the efforts which have uninterruptedly been
made to prevent, as far as possible, the instruction from
becoming one of routine. For educational instruction
is, of a certainty, exposed to no greater danger. As
matters have developed themselves, the Seminary has
always had the opportunity of choosing suitable men
and women assistant-teachers for any course from out
of the great number of students in previous courses. 
This can be done without feeling any sense of being
bound for the future; for these occasional assistants in 
sloyd instruction have, as a rule, permanent places in
other schools. In accordance with the principle always
strongly emphasized at Nääs,
that the true educational
instruction should be <i>individual</i>
and not arranged as class
instruction, each teacher is
given a division which only
with unwillingness is allowed
to include more than 18—20
persons.

<img><small>Series of models</small></img>

During the first courses,
a model-series consisting of
one hundred models was
followed, but after 1880 this
series was divided into two, a <i>fundamental</i> series and
one of <i>repetition</i>, each including fifty models. Both these
series were arranged with easy starting-points, so that
even those who were going through the repetition series, 
— those who were enjoying a second or third course 
— did not at once receive a comparatively difficult task.
The series, too, were so arranged that when united they
formed a whole, i. e., a series of one hundred models. 
In 1887 four independent series were arranged, i. e., a
<i>fundamental series</i> more especially intended for
elementary schools in country districts, <i>a series for town-schools</i>,
meant for elementary schools in towns, <i>a high-school
series</i>, intended for high schools for boys, and a <i>series
for girl-schools</i>, intended for high schools for girls. 
This latter series was done away with in 1887, while
in 1894 the so-called <i>abridged fundamental series</i> was
formed, intended too for elementary schools in the
country-districts, but so far concentrated that it included
only forty numbers, while each of the other series 
sisted of fifty. Since the beginning of 1902 by far
the greater number of the students follow the Nääs
new series of models,
which, consisting of
40 numbers, is
intended to take the
place of all the series
of models previously
used.

<img><small>Examination of models</small></img>

In arranging a
series of models, the
<i>exercises</i> entering into
this kind of sloyd are made the basis for a gradual
progression. This is a characteristic of the Nääs method. 
For by this means it has been found possible to maintain 
the demand made of the partakers in the course,
that the work executed by them should be neat and
exact. They have not been allowed to hand in incorrect
or halfdone work and, even if, as may be, more than
one student, unaccustomed to such neatness and exactness, 
has complained of the “pedantic way” in which
the work of the students has been examined, the
complaints have been received with equanimity. For it is
undoubtedly owing to the maintainance of these strict
requirements that it has been possible to open the way
to the schools for a system of sloyd-instruction which
laid weight, not upon the amount, but upon the quality
of the work executed.

***

The scrutinizing of the work executed, and the giving
of marks for the same, is carried out by the Director
or by the head-teacher in the presence of six or seven
of the students in regular turn: these latter have to 
see that the marks are given impartially, and have also
an opportunity of acquiring a knowledge of the grounds
on which the marking is
based. Before a piece of
work is sent in to be
marked, the assistant-teacher 
shall, by means
of a preparatory scrutiny,
see that the student,
before finally touching up
the model, has made the greatest possible use of the
so-called <i>sharp</i> tools. At the final scrutiny we first
mentioned, each work is given one of the marks 5, 4,
3, 2, 1 or 0. The latter mark signifies that it has not
been found possible to pass the piece of work in question,
either because it exceeds or does not approach the
fixed measures by at least 3 mm., or else because it
is unsatisfactory in some other respect. The models
which are approved of are marked with the stamp of
the institution.

<img><small>Björkenääs</small></img>

<img><small>Mellannääs</small></img>

For practical reasons the marks are given in ciphers,
whose signification is first made known towards the end
of the course. These cipher-marks, as well as the
remarks made on faulty work are written in a “scrutiny-journal”, 
accessible to the students, in which there is a
certain page for each of
them. The number of
the page corresponds
to the “secret number”,
given to each student at
the beginning of the
course and with which
he afterwards distinguishes 
his work. The use 
of ciphers instead of names is a further guarantee of
objectivity in the giving of the marks. The average mark
for neatness and exactness
in the execution of a piece
of work afterwards forms a
factor in the total-mark given
to each student at the end
of the course. The other
factors in calculating this
total-mark are: the number
of exercises performed in
making the models which
have been passed, the
independence shown in their
working and the time which
has been required for their
execution.

<img><small>“Extra models“</small></img>

In this total-mark we have mentioned, is also included,
however, the mark for the so-called “alternative model”
or, as it is usually termed, the “extra model”. Since
1892 each student is required during the fifth week of
the course to solve a task given simultaneously to
each, a task which is of such a kind that it differs
according to the stand-point on which the executant
happens to have reached at the time. The task includes 
the construction, drawing and execution of a model
suitable for incorporation as an alternative model in
one of the Nääs model-series. It is required that the
model shall include the number of new exercises
calculated for that number of model, in addition to
which, the preceding exercises, but no additional ones
may be applied.	The model which is thus
executed according to the drawings made by the student
himself or herself, are judged from practical, 
methodical and esthetical points of view, regard being
paid to that amount of inventiveness which may have
been displayed by the student in the execution of
his task. In addition, this “extra model” is scrutinized
in <i>respect to its execution</i> in accordance with the same
principles as those determining the mark given to the
ordinary models. Although this “extra model” cannot
be said to enjoy the special love of the students, it is
beyond all doubt of very great value, not only for a
right understanding of the method and as an exercise
in “creating” in the sense given to the word by Fröbel,
but also for purely practical reasons, as the student
thereby gets some idea as to how he shall, within
the framework of the Nääs method, be able to change
a model in the series which may not be very suitable
for the district in
which his school is
situated, for one more
fit. While the other
models executed by
the students may
be taken home, the
“extra model” is left
to increase the
collection of the
institution, a collection which now includes about 3,000
models constructed and executed by the students at
the courses.

<i>Drawing</i> stands, of course, in the closest connection
with sloyd, and that in many respects. Even in the
execution of the most primitive work, a kind of
construction must be a guiding help, and the more 
importance one puts on producing a work correct in form
and size, all the more carefully must one previously
construct the necessary contours upon the piece of
work to be constructed. This is done partly with the
help of the ruler and compass, and, in solitary cases, by
hand alone. When instruction in sloyd is being given,
however, sloyd and
drawing should be
presented in
another connection
than this of a drawing 
upon the piece
of work to be
constructed. The
pupils should be
exercised both in
drawing copies of the models and in executing sloydwork
from the drawings. During a good many years attempts
have been made at Nääs to discover how this
connection between drawing and sloyd should be arranged in
a way which could satisfy both pedagogic and practical
points of view. At present the method is so arranged
that the student has to draw the model on paper
before executing it in the sloyd-room. During the last few
years, presence at the drawing-lessons has been compulsory. 
All the students are also expected to take part
twice daily in the gymnastic exercises which are arranged
in accordance with the Swedish—Ling’s—system.

To this principal task of laboring for the introduction
into schools of a pedagogically conceived and a methodically 
arranged instruction in sloyd, the Seminary has 
joined others. Thus, courses for the training of leaders
of <i>games</i> have been given at Nääs since 1895. For
in Sweden as well as in a great many other countries,
it has become evident that the young people of both
sexes have, to a certain extent, lost all interest in
playing games, and that even a knowledge of, and
skill in different kinds of games have diminished in
a very serious degree. The causes of this condition
of things — a very painful one to every friend of a
healthy and natural youth—are many, but in any
case it appears to be the duty of every educator to
endeavor to do what can be done to counteract them. 
So, in addition to sloyd-courses there have also been
arranged at Nääs <i>courses for male and female teachers,
in the theory and practice of out-door games</i>. 

<img><small>Games</small></img>

Fifteen
such courses have hitherto been given which have
been attended by a total of 381 students, of which
number 298 are from Sweden and 83 from other
countries. These teachers of both sexes who
participate in the game-courses exercise out-door games
suitable for children and youth — running games, ball
games, games to the accompaniment of song, etc. — 
out in the playing field or, in case of unfavorable
weather, in the gymnasium. A special house for the
practice of the games is now under construction. In 
addition to this, lectures are given and discussions
held on general pedagogics and on the theory and
history of games. The course also includes the making
of the more simpler requisites for the games, and
especially of different kinds of balls, and exercises in
giving instructions as to the playing of the games. At
present two such courses are held annually; the one
given in the early summer lasting six weeks, and
that held later in the summer four. Special evening
courses in games are arranged for those who are taking
part in the sloyd-courses given during the summer,
whereby about 800 male and female teachers have been
trained as leaders of games.

<img><small>Games</small></img>

Besides the courses in sloyd and games there are
at present arranged at Nääs courses for instruction <i>in
fruitpreserving</i> and in <i>gardening</i> (since 1902), and courses
in <i>school-cookery</i> and in <i>needlework</i> (since 1903).

The instruction in the first-named course, which
embraces both the preserving of fruit and lectures on the
subject, is intended to make the students in the course
male and female teachers and wives and daughters
of teachers familiar with the drying, salting, and
preserving of the products in question; the boiling of
fruit, its hermetical boiling for the purpose of preservation, 
the making of sirups, the making into jams, and 
other methods of making preserves. 

<img><small>Course for gardening</small></img>

At the course for
<i>gardening</i>, the male and female teachers from the country
districts receive
instruction, based on
practical exercises,
in the proper laying-out 
and care of a
school garden. 

<img><small>Course in school-cookery</small></img>

The
course in
<i>school-cookery</i> is intended
to impart a
knowledge of the daily
events in the sphere
of the home and the household, and a practical skill
in household duties,
partly for the
immediate benefit of
the students in the
course, and partly
that those students
may be able to give
instruction in the
subject. And, finally,
the courses in <i>needlework</i> 
are intended to train women-teachers from country
schools as teachers also in needlework, such as knitting,
sewing, mending and marking.

***

On the 6th. of May, 1898, <i>August Abrahamson</i>, the
founder of the Nääs Slöjdlärareseminarium, departed
this life after having reached the great age of more
than eighty. But in order that the work to which he
had devoted the last 25 years of a busy life should be
able to continue its existence after his death, he made 
the following
dispositions amongst
others in his will:

The educational
establishment
founded by him shall for
all future time be
kept up at Nääs
under the name of
<i>“August Abrahamsons 
Stiftelse“ (Foundation)</i>. Its aim shall be, by the
continued training of
male and female
teachers who have already
devoted themselves to
the task of instruction,
to work for education
in general and
especially for the
employment in that cause of
pedagogic sloyd. It is moreover determined that the
activity of the Foundation shall, as
far as its funds permit, always be
carried on in accordance with the
demands of the times. The
Foundation, endowed with the Nääs
estate with its dependencies, and
the personal estate appertaining
thereto together with a capital of
380,000 kronor (1 krona = 27
cents = 1 sh. 1 d.) is donated
to the State. The total value of
the Foundation may be estimated
at about 700,000 kronor. The 

<img><small>"/“The grave“</small></img>
<img><small>Drawing room</small></img>
<img><small>Dining room</small></img>

will further determines that Otto Salomon, the testator’s
nephew, who has directed the institution ever since its
establishment, shall be entitled during his life-time to
continue his directorship either personally or by deputy,
and to be the sole administrator of the Foundation, with
unlimited power and authority to determine everything
connected with the educational work of the institution.
Finally, it is the will of the deceased that male and
female teachers from foreign lands shall also be allowed
to enjoy training at the school. By a mandate dated 28
April 1899, His Majesty in Council has, on behalf of
the State, expressed himself willing to accept the Foundation 
on the conditions determined by the testator.
<i>The August Abrahamson Stiftelse</i> has thus been
transformed from being an entirely private establishment to a
State Institution.

***

<img><small>The Castle</small></img>

The Nääs estate which has been donated to the Foundation 
embraces an area of about 1200 hectares (almost
3000 acres) of which, it is true, the greater part
consists of forest land, while
125 hectares are under
cultivation, 100 hectares
of this forming the home
farm and the remainder
being let on lease. The
main building, the <i>Castle</i>
as it is called, contains
a number of large, and
in part splendidly
decorated rooms containing very valuable furniture. According 
to the provisions of the will, the state rooms are 
to be used when occasion requires, for meetings and
festivities: the sleeping apartments are to be
retained for the use of
prominent personages
who are interested in
the institution and
therefore desire to
spend some short time
at Nääs. The great
salon on the other
hand which, with its
<i>empire</i> furniture,
occupies the whole width
of the upper story is used for the more solemn
opening and closing of the courses, as well as for
occasional lectures and discussions. 

<img><small>Hall</small></img>

The castle has also
a winter garden built in connection with it, and an
extensive park with large gardens. Among the buildings which
are intended to form more directly the school etablishment 
may be noticed: the <i>Seminarium</i>, containing a lecture
room, three sloyd rooms, a model room, dwelling-rooms
etc.; <i>Björkenääs</i>, the residence of the Director, <i>Vänhem</i>,
with dining-rooms and drawing-rooms, spare bed-rooms
etc.; <i>Källnääs</i>, containing a large sloyd-room, a gymnasium
and bed-rooms, and
<i>Mellannääs</i>, <i>Lilla Nääs</i>,
<i>Babel</i> and other
buildings intended as
dwelling-places for the
students. Outside
Mellannääs lies the
playground intended for the
out-door sports. 

<img><small>Library</small></img>

In a
special pavilion there 
is a newly formed pedagogic library for the use of
students. A large building intended for games in rainy
weather and for the giving of lectures is in course of
construction. Quite near the Seminarium is the <i>model
school-garden</i>, newly laid out in 1902.

In connection with
the Foundation there
are in addition the
Nääs Verktygsförsäljning, 
whose mission 
is to provide
schools at home and
abroad with benches
and tools for
instruction in
wood-sloyd,; and the Nääs Skolmöbeltillverkning, a little factory
for the making of schoolfurniture such as schooldesks,
blackboards etc., manufactured after good models.

<img><small>The Factory</small></img>

It is, perhaps, not unworthy of mention that Nääs,
the principal parts of which are situated on and
around the little lake of “Säfvelången” (“the long
lake of reeds”), is widely celebrated for the beauty
of its scenery.

<img><small>“Säfvelången“</small></img>

***

It was at Nääs that
the fundamental
principles of the so-called
“Nääs-system” were
formulated, and that
the “Nääs-method”, as
it is called, was
elaborated and tried. The
chief reason that so 
many male and female teachers, often from foreign
countries, visit this Swedish educational establishment is, of
course, their wish to become acquainted at first hand with
the <i>Swedish pedagogic sloyd</i> and its method. Neither the
plan nor the space of this little pamphlet permits to here
give a more detailed account of these. We must therefore
be contented with a few, very brief words on the subject.
Those who are interested in the matter would do best
to come and see with
their own eyes; would
do best to learn by
actual experience, and not
from reading, the
distinguishing marks of
instruction in Swedish
sloyd.

<img><small>Salon</small></img>

The Nääs system was
first mentioned in
connection with its
significance as a system for training in work, whose aim
was chiefly pedagogical and not economical. The two
important fundamental rules of the system stand, of
course, in close connection with this; — the rules
that the instruction shall be methodical, i. e., be given
in a <i>methodical</i> way — this in contrast with the plan
formerly employed of allowing exterior contingencies
to determine what should be executed by the pupil — 
and that the instruction should be given by a <i>pedagogically 
trained</i> person and not by the first artisan who
offered himself. According to the Nääs-system, instruction 
in sloyd shall constitute a factor in <i>general education</i>, 
and not be a direct training for any special handicraft. 
In opposition to other systems which permit the
time and strength of the pupils to be divided and 
expended upon several kinds of work, the Nääs system
has maintained the necessity of <i>concentrating the instruction</i> 
upon one branch of sloyd, that of <i>wood-sloyd</i>, the
most suitable of all. Other important fundamental
principles are: that the instruction shall be <i>voluntary</i>,
not compulsory; that <i>useful objects</i> and not articles of
luxury shall be made; that the instruction shall be
<i>individual</i> and not arranged as class-teaching; that the
articles made shall become <i>the property of the children</i>
and not be sold for the benefit of the school; that the
work <i>should be carefully executed</i> and not carelessly
done, and that the work shall be carried out with <i>the
body kept in a good position</i>. It may perhaps seem
that all these propositions appear to be pretty self-evident 
and scarcely worth mentioning. But they, and
several others have first been adopted as parts of a
connected whole, in the Nääs system, and each of them
has had to strive hard in order to gain any great
degree of general recognition. Some — as, for example,
the important rule that all instruction which is
educational in the true sense of the word should be
individual — have still many opponents, both in theory and
in practice. Still we have a lively conviction that even
their time shall come; that time when there shall exist
no difference between the principles which make up the
Nääs system, and those which shall then form the
generally recognized principles of education.

***

Concerning the <i>Nääs method</i>, its chief characteristic
is, that, in contrast with many other methods in the 
sphere of instruction in manual labor, it does not build
upon practice in abstract exercises, — sawing, planing,
the use of the chisel etc. etc. — but upon the making
of <i>concrete objects which can be used in daily life, and
which are good when viewed from an esthetical standpoint</i>.
A series of models is used as a guide in instruction; this
series, again, being based upon an <i>exercise-series</i> of 68
exercises. As a result of the model-series being based
upon exercises, any one model can be exchanged for
another which may be more suitable for the place where
the instruction is being given. Thus, in the matter of
instruction in sloyd, the Nääs system has endeavored
to apply the didactic rules of proceeding from the easy
to the more difficult, from the simpler to the more
complex, from the concrete to the more abstract. As
patterns, the Nääs method employs models, both models
and drawings, and also drawings exclusively. Amongst
the models there are many which are termed “modelling-models” 
which, similarly to modelling work in general,
is of great importance for the development of the eye
and the sense of form. Especial weight is laid upon
employment of the <i>knife</i>, which, according to the Nääs
system, should be the fundamental tool.

***

Finally, without entering into any further details, we
wish to fix the attention of the reader upon the fact
that the Nääs-system and the Nääs-method, both products
principally of the joint work of Swedish teachers has,
year after year, gained greater dissemination and more
adherents and that not in Sweden alone, but also in many 
other countries. It is, of course, quite natural that, when
they are transplanted to foreign soils, both national and
local peculiarities
must be regarded,
and for this reason
Nääs has continually 
warned the
teacher: <i>Remember,
that you can work
according to our
system without 
using one of our
models, and that it
is possible to use
our models and
still not follow our
system.</i> We hope
that they have
understood this
admonition, and thus
will never forget that the letter of the law killeth, but
that the spirit giveth life.
